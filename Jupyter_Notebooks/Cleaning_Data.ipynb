All hearts are filled with grief and horror at the hideous crime which has darkened our land, and the memory of the murdered President, his protracted sufferings, his unyielding fortitude, the example and achievements of his life, and the pathos of his death will forever illumine the pages of our history. For the fourth time the officer elected by the people and ordained by the Constitution to fill a vacancy so created is called to assume the Executive chair. The wisdom of our fathers, foreseeing even the most dire possibilities, made sure that the Government should never be imperiled because of the uncertainty of human life. Men may die, but the fabrics of our free institutions remain unshaken. No higher or more assuring proof could exist of the strength and permanence of popular government than the fact that though the chosen of the people be struck down his constitutional successor is peacefully installed without shock or strain except the sorrow which mourns the bereavement. All the noble aspirations of my lamented predecessor which found expression in his life, the measures devised and suggested during his brief Administration to correct abuses, to enforce economy, to advance prosperity, and to promote the general welfare, to Insure domestic security and maintain friendly and honorable relations with the nations of the earth, will be garnered in the hearts of the people; and it will be my earnest endeavor to profit, and to see that the nation shall profit, by his example and experience. Prosperity blesses our country. Our fiscal policy is fixed by law, is well grounded and generally approved. No threatening issue mars our foreign intercourse, and the wisdom, integrity, and thrift of our people may be trusted to continue undisturbed the present assured career of peace, tranquilly, and welfare. The gloom and anxiety which have enshrouded the country must make repose especially welcome now. No demand for speedy legislation has been heard; no adequate occasion is apparent for an unusual session of Congress. The Constitution defines the functions and powers of the executive as clearly as those of either of the other two departments of the Government, and he must answer for the just exercise of the discretion it permits and the performance of the duties it imposes. Summoned to these high duties and responsibilities and profoundly conscious of their magnitude and gravity, I assume the trust imposed by the Constitution, relying for aid on divine guidance and the virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of the American people\",\n          \"To the Senate of the United States: I have the satisfaction to communicate to the Senate the results of the negotiations recently had in this city with the British minister, special and extraordinary. These results comprise First. A treaty to settle and define the boundaries between the territories of the United States and the possessions of Her Britannic Majesty in North America, for the suppression of the African slave trade, and the surrender of criminals fugitive from justice in certain cases. Second. A correspondence on the subject of the interference of the colonial authorities of the British West Indies with American merchant vessels driven by stress of weather or carried by violence into the ports of those colonies. Third. A correspondence upon the subject of the attack and destruction of the steamboat Caroline. Fourth. A correspondence on the subject of impressment. If this treaty shall receive the approbation of the Senate, it will terminate a difference respecting boundary which has long subsisted between the two Governments, has been the subject of several ineffectual attempts at settlement, and has sometimes led to great irritation, not without danger of disturbing the existing peace. Both the United States and the States more immediately concerned have entertained no doubt of the validity of the American title to all the territory which has been in dispute, but that title was controverted and the Government of the United States had agreed to make the dispute a subject of arbitration. One arbitration had been actually had, but had failed to settle the controversy, and it was found at the commencement of last year that a correspondence had been in progress between the two Governments for a joint commission, with an ultimate reference to an umpire or arbitrator with authority to make a final decision. That correspondence, however, had been retarded by various occurrences, and had come to no definite result when the special mission of Lord Ashburton was announced. This movement on the part of England afforded in the judgment of the Executive a favorable opportunity for making an attempt to settle this long existing controversy by some agreement or treaty without further reference to arbitration. It seemed entirely proper that if this purpose were entertained consultation should be had with the authorities of the States of Maine and Massachusetts. Letters, therefore, of which copies are herewith communicated, were addressed to the governors of those States, suggesting that commissioners should be appointed by each of them, respectively, to repair to this city and confer with the authorities of this Government on a line by agreement or compromise, with its equivalents and compensations. This suggestion was met by both States in a spirit of candor and patriotism and promptly complied with. Four commissioners on the part of Maine and three on the part of Massachusetts, all persons of distinction and high character, were duly appointed and commissioned and lost no time in presenting themselves at the seat of the Government of the United States. These commissioners have been in correspondence with this Government during the period of the discussions; have enjoyed its confidence and freest communications; have aided the general object with their counsel and advice, and in the end have unanimously signified their assent to the line proposed in the treaty. Ordinarily it would be no easy task to reconcile and bring together such a variety of interests in a matter in itself difficult and perplexed, but the efforts of the Government in attempting to accomplish this desirable object have been seconded and sustained by a spirit of accommodation and conciliation on the part of the States concerned, to which much of the success of these efforts is to be ascribed. Connected with the settlement of the line of the northeastern boundary, so far as it respects the States of Maine and Massachusetts, is the continuation of that line along the highlands to the northwesternmost head of Connecticut River. Which of the sources of that stream is entitled to this character has been matter of controversy and of some interest to the State of New Hampshire. The King of the Netherlands decided the main branch to be the northwesternmost head of the Connecticut. This did not satisfy the claim of New Hampshire. The line agreed to in the present treaty follows the highlands to the head of Halls Stream and thence down that river, embracing the whole claim of New Hampshire and establishing her title to 100,000 acres of territory more than she would have had by the decision of the King of the Netherlands. By the treaty of 1783 the line is to proceed down the Connecticut River to the forty-fifth degree of north latitude, and thence west by that parallel till it strikes the St. Lawrence. Recent examinations having ascertained that the line heretofore received as the true line of latitude between those points was erroneous, and that the correction of this error would not only leave on the British side a considerable tract of territory heretofore supposed to belong to the States of Vermont and New York, but also Rouses Point, the site of a military work of the United States, it has been regarded as an object of importance not only to establish the rights and jurisdiction of those States up to the line to which they have been considered to extend, but also to comprehend Rouses Point within the territory of the United States. The relinquishment by the British Government of all the territory south of the line heretofore considered to be the true line has been obtained, and the consideration for this relinquishment is to inure by the provisions of the treaty to the States of Maine and Massachusetts. The line of boundary, then, from the source of the St. Croix to the St. Lawrence, so far as Maine and Massachusetts are concerned, is fixed by their own consent and for considerations satisfactory to them, the chief of these considerations being the privilege of transporting the lumber and agricultural products grown and raised in Maine on the waters of the St. Johns and its tributaries down that river to the ocean free from imposition or disability. The importance of this privilege, perpetual in its terms, to a country covered at present by pine forests of great value, and much of it capable hereafter of agricultural improvement, is not a matter upon which the opinion of intelligent men is likely to be divided. So far as New Hampshire is concerned, the treaty secures all that she requires, and New York and Vermont are quieted to the extent of their claim and occupation. The difference which would be made in the northern boundary of these two States by correcting the parallel of latitude may be seen on Tanner's maps ( 1836 ), new atlas, maps Nos. 6 and 9. From the intersection of the forty-fifth degree of north latitude with the St. Lawrence and along that river and the lakes to the water communication between Lake Huron and Lake Superior the line was definitively agreed on by the commissioners of the two Governments under the sixth article of the treaty of Ghent; but between this last-mentioned point and the Lake of the Woods the commissioners acting under the seventh article of that treaty found several matters of disagreement, and therefore made no joint report to their respective Governments. The first of these was Sugar Island, or St. Georges Island, lying in St. Marys River, or the water communication between Lakes Huron and Superior. By the present treaty this island is embraced in the territories of the United States. Both from soil and position it is regarded as of much value. Another matter of difference was the manner of extending the line from the point at which the commissioners arrived, north of Isle Royale, in Lake Superior, to the Lake of the Woods. The British commissioner insisted on proceeding to Fond du Lac, at the southwest angle of the lake, and thence by the river St. Louis to the Rainy Lake. The American commissioner supposed the true course to be to proceed by way of the Dog River. Attempts were made to compromise this difference, but without success. The details of these proceedings are found at length in the printed separate reports of the commissioners. From the imperfect knowledge of this remote country at the date of the treaty of peace, some of the descriptions in that treaty do not harmonize with its natural features as now ascertained. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cLong Lake\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is nowhere to be found under that name. There is reason for supposing, however, that the sheet of water intended by that name is the estuary at the mouth of Pigeon River. The present treaty therefore adopts that estuary and river, and afterwards pursues the usual route across the height of land by the various portages and small lakes till the line reaches Rainy Lake, from which the commissioners agreed on the extension of it to its termination in the northwest angle of the Lake of the Woods. The region of country on and near the shore of the lake between Pigeon River on the north and Fond du Lac and the river St. Louis on the south and west, considered valuable as a mineral region, is thus included within the United States. It embraces a territory of 4,000,000 acres northward of the claim set up by the British commissioner under the treaty of Ghent. From the height of land at the head of Pigeon River westerly to the Rainy Lake the country is understood to be of little value, being described by surveyors and marked on the map as a region of rock and water. From the northwest angle of the Lake of the Woods, which is found to be in latitude Coast 190 The 23 ' 55 \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnorth, existing treaties require the line to be run due south to its intersection with the forty-fifth parallel, and thence along that parallel to the Rocky Mountains. After sundry informal communications with the British minister upon the subject of the claims of the two countries to territory west of the Rocky Mountains, so little probability was found to exist of coming to any agreement on that subject at present that it was not thought expedient to make it one of the subjects of formal negotiation to be entered upon between this Government and the British minister as part of his duties under his special mission. By the treaty of 1783 the line of division along the rivers and lakes from the place where the forty-fifth parallel of north latitude strikes the St. Lawrence to the outlet of Lake Superior is invariably to be drawn through the middle of such waters, and not through the middle of their main channels. Such a line, if extended according to the literal terms of the treaty, would, it is obvious, occasionally intersect islands. The manner in which the commissioners of the two Governments dealt with this difficult subject may be seen in their reports. But where the line thus following the middle of the river or water course did not meet with islands, yet it was liable sometimes to leave the only practicable navigable channel altogether on one side. The treaty made no provision for the common use of the waters by the citizens and subjects of both countries. It has happened, therefore, in a few instances that the use of the river in particular places would be greatly diminished to one party or the other if in fact there was not a choice in the use of channels and passages. Thus at the Long Sault, in the St. Lawrence- a dangerous passage, practicable only for boats the only safe run is between the Long Sault Islands and Barnharts Island ( all which belong to the United States ) on one side and the American shore on the other. On the other hand, by far the best passage for vessels of any depth of water from Lake Erie into the Detroit River is between Bois Blanc, a British island, and the Canadian shore. So again, there are several channels or passages, of different degrees of facility and usefulness, between the several islands in the river St. Clair at or near its entry into the lake of that name. In these three cases the treaty provides that all the several passages and channels shall be free and open to the use of the citizens and subjects of both parties. The treaty obligations subsisting between the two countries for the suppression of the African slave trade and the complaints made to this Government within the last three or four years, many of them but too well founded, of the visitation, seizure, and detention of American vessels on that coast by British cruisers could not but form a delicate and highly important part of the negotiations which have now been held. The early and prominent part which the Government of the United States has taken for the abolition of this unlawful and inhuman traffic is well known. By the tenth article of the treaty of Ghent it is declared that the traffic in slaves is irreconcilable with the principles of humanity and justice, and that both His Majesty and the United States are desirous of continuing their efforts to promote its entire abolition; and it is thereby agreed that both the contracting parties shall use their best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object. The Government of the United States has by law declared the African slave trade piracy, and at its suggestion other nations have made similar enactments. It has not been wanting in honest and zealous efforts, made in conformity with the wishes of the whole country, to accomplish the entire abolition of the traffic in slaves upon the African coast, but these efforts and those of other countries directed to the same end have proved to a considerable degree unsuccessful. Treaties are known to have been entered into some years ago between England and France by which the former power, which usually maintains a large naval force on the African station, was authorized to seize and bring in for adjudication vessels found engaged in the slave trade under the French flag. It is known that in December last a treaty was signed in London by the representatives of England, France, Russia, Prussia, and Austria having for its professed object a strong and united effort of the five powers to put an end to the traffic. This treaty was not officially communicated to the Government of the United States, but its provisions and stipulations are supposed to be accurately known to the public. It is understood to be not yet ratified on the part of France. No application or request has been made to this Government to become party to this treaty, but the course it might take in regard to it has exalted no small degree of attention and discussion in Europe, as the principle upon which it is founded and the stipulations which it contains have caused warm animadversions and great political excitement. In my message at the commencement of the present session of Congress I endeavored to state the principles which this Government supports respecting the right of search and the immunity of flags. Desirous of maintaining those principles fully, at the same time that existing obligations should be fulfilled, I have thought it most consistent with the honor and dignity of the country that it should execute its own laws and perform its own obligations by its own means and its own power. The examination or visitation of the merchant vessels of one nation by the cruisers of another for any purpose except those known and acknowledged by the law of nations, under whatever restraints or regulations it may take place, may lead to dangerous results. It is far better by other means to supersede any supposed necessity or any motive for such examination or visit. Interference with a merchant vessel by an armed cruiser is always a delicate proceeding, apt to touch the point of national honor as well as to affect the interests of individuals. It has been thought, therefore, expedient, not only in accordance with the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent, but at the same time as removing all pretext on the part of others for violating the immunities of the American flag upon the seas, as they exist and are defined by the law of nations, to enter into the articles now submitted to the Senate. The treaty which I now submit to you proposes no alteration, mitigation, or, modification of the rules of the law of nations. It provides simply that each of the two Governments shall maintain on the coast of Africa a sufficient squadron to enforce separately and respectively the laws, rights, and obligations of the two countries for the suppression of the slave trade. Another consideration of great importance has recommended this mode of fulfilling the duties and obligations of the country. Our commerce along the western coast of Africa is extensive, and supposed to be increasing. There is reason to think that in many cases those engaged in it have met with interruptions and annoyances caused by the jealousy and instigation of rivals engaged in the same trade. Many complaints on this subject have reached the Government. A respectable naval force on the coast is the natural resort and security against further occurrences of this kind. The surrender to justice of persons who, having committed high crimes, seek an asylum in the territories of a neighboring nation would seem to be an act due to the cause of general justice and properly belonging to the present state of civilization and intercourse. The British Provinces of North America are separated from the States of the Union by a line of several thousand miles, and along portions of this line the amount of population on either side is quite considerable, while the passage of the boundary is always easy. Offenders against the law on the one side transfer themselves to the other. Sometimes, with great difficulty, they are brought to justice, but very often they wholly escape. A consciousness of immunity from the power of avoiding justice in this way instigates the unprincipled and reckless to the commission of offenses, and the peace and good neighborhood of the border are consequently often disturbed. In the case of offenders fleeing from Canada into the United States, the governors of States are often applied to for their surrender, and questions of a very embarrassing nature arise from these applications. It has been thought highly important, therefore, to provide for the whole case by a proper treaty stipulation. The article on the subject in the proposed treaty is carefully confined to such offenses as all mankind agree to regard as heinous and destructive of the security of life and property. In this careful and specific enumeration of crimes the object has been to exclude all political offenses or criminal charges arising from wars or intestine commotions. Treason, misprision of treason, libels, desertion from military service, and other offenses of similar character are excluded. And lest some unforeseen inconvenience or unexpected abuse should arise from the stipulation rendering its continuance in the opinion of one or both of the parties not longer desirable, it is left in the power of either to put an end to it at will. The destruction of the steamboat Caroline at Schlosser four or five years ago occasioned no small degree of excitement at the time, and became the subject of correspondence between the two Governments. That correspondence, having been suspended for a considerable period, was renewed in the spring of the last year, but no satisfactory result having been arrived at, it was thought proper, though the occurrence had ceased to be fresh and recent, not to omit attention to it on the present occasion. It has only been so far discussed in the correspondence now submitted as it was accomplished by a violation of the territory of the United States. The letter of the British minister, while he attempts to justify that violation upon the ground of a pressing and overruling necessity, admitting, nevertheless, that even if justifiable an apology was due for it, and accompanying this acknowledgment with assurances of the sacred regard of his Government for the inviolability of national territory, has seemed to me sufficient to warrant forbearance from any further remonstrance against what took place as an aggression on the soil and territory of the country. On the subject of the interference of the British authorities in the West Indies, a confident hope is entertained that the correspondence which has taken place, showing the grounds taken by this Government and the engagements entered into by the British minister, will be found such as to satisfy the just expectation of the people of the United States. The impressment of seamen from merchant vessels of this country by British cruisers, although not practiced in time of peace, and therefore not at present a productive cause of difference and irritation, has, nevertheless, hitherto been so prominent a topic of controversy and is so likely to bring on renewed contentions at the first breaking out of a European war that it has been thought the part of wisdom now to take it into serious and earnest consideration. The letter from the Secretary of State to the British minister explains the ground which the Government has assumed and the principles which it means to uphold. For the defense of these grounds and the maintenance of these principles the most perfect reliance is placed on the intelligence of the American people and on their firmness and patriotism in whatever touches the honor of the country or its great and essential interests. JOHN TYLER. ( The following are inserted because they pertain to the treaty transmitted with the message of President Tyler immediately preceding. ) DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, August 3, 1848. To the Senate of the United States: The Secretary of State has the honor to transmit to the Senate, in compliance with a resolution adopted by it on the 29th ultimo, a copy of the joint report of the commissioners under the treaty of Washington of August 9, 1842, together with a copy of the report of the American commissioner transmitting the same to the State Department. JAMES BUCHANAN. Mr. Smith to Mr. Buchanan. WASHINGTON, April 20, 1848. In presenting to you the joint report of the commissioners appointed under the treaty of Washington of August 9, 1842, to survey and mark the line of boundary between the United States and the British Provinces, which I have the honor herewith most respectfully to submit, I have to perform the painful duty of informing you that the maps of that line and of the adjacent country, which had been elaborately constructed by the scientific corps on the part of the United States, and contained upon 100 sheets of drawing paper of the largest size, together with the tables of the survey, have been destroyed by the conflagration of the building in which they were contained. This house had been occupied by Major James D. Graham, the head of the scientific corps and principal astronomer of the American commission, as his office until his departure for Mexico. All the maps, drawings, and tables had been completed and duly authenticated by the joint commissioners, and were ready to be deposited with their joint report under their hands and seals in the archives of this Government. Of this I had the honor to inform you in my letter of the 24th ultimo. I can hardly express the pain which this unfortunate event has occasioned me. But I can not perceive that any imputation of blame can properly be attached to any officer of the commission. The care and custody of all the work of the United States scientific corps were properly placed in charge of Major Graham, as the head of that corps, who had had the immediate direction and superintendence of it from the first organization of the commission. He required the maps and tables at his office for reference and revision in the progress of the astronomical work. Upon his departure for Mexico he placed Lieutenant A. W. Whipple in his rooms with an injunction to guard with the utmost care the valuable property of the commission. On the day after he left the city, and when for the first time informed of the fact, I called upon Lieutenant Whipple and requested him to have all the maps, drawings, and tables ready to be turned over to the State Department on the following day. On the 24th ultimo I acquainted you with that fact. No censure can possibly be attributed to Lieutenant Whipple, whose great care and attention to all his duties have been on all occasions highly distinguished. He escaped from the fire with scarcely an article of his dress, and his loss in money and clothing is at least $ 1,000. Major Graham has lost his valuable library, together with personal effects to a large amount. The fire was communicated from the basement of the house, and by no effort could anything be saved. There are tracings of the maps upon\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d tissue paper, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cwithout the topography, in the State of Maine, but they are not signed by the commissioners. The field books of the engineers were, fortunately, not in Major Graham's office, and are preserved. Duplicates of the maps, duly authenticated, have been placed in the British archives at London, which, although they have not the topography of the country so fully laid down upon them as it was upon our own, represent with equal exactness the survey of the boundary itself. Should it be deemed expedient by this Government to procure copies of them, access to those archives for that purpose would undoubtedly be permitted, and the object accomplished at small expense, and when completed these copies could be authenticated by the joint commissioners in accordance with the provisions of the treaty. I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient and humble servant, ALBERT SMITH. Report of the Joint commission of boundary appointed under the treaty of Washington of August 9, 1842. The undersigned, commissioners appointed under the treaty of Washington to trace and mark the boundary, as directed by that treaty, between the British possessions in North America and the United States that is to say, James Buckhall Estcourt, lieutenant-colonel in the British army, appointed commissioner by Her Britannic Majesty, and Albert Smith, appointed commissioner by the President of the United States -having accomplished the duty assigned to them, do now, in accordance with the directions of the said treaty, submit the following report and the accompanying maps, jointly signed, to their respective Governments. In obedience to the terms of the treaty, the undersigned met at Bangor, in the State of Maine, on the 1st day of May, 1843, where they produced and verified the authority under which they each were respectively to act. They then adjourned, because the weather was not sufficiently open for taking the field, to the 1st of the following month ( June ), and agreed to meet again at that time at Houlton. Accordingly, they did meet at that place, and began their operations. It may be desirable to state at the outset that for the sake of convenience the whole line of boundary marked by the undersigned has been divided in the mention made of the different portions into the following grand divisions, viz:\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d North line, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfrom the source of the St. Croix to the intersection of the St. John.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d River St. John, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfrom the intersection of the north line to the mouth of the St. Francis.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d River St. Francis, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfrom its mouth to the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Southwest line, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfrom the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook to the Northwest Branch of the St. John.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d South line, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfrom the Northwest Branch to the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25 ' on the Southwest Branch.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Southwest Branch, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfrom the parallel Congress.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d 6 25 ' to its source. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cHighlands,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d from the source of the Southwest Branch of the St. John to the source of Halls Stream. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cHalls Streams\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d from its source to the intersection of the line of Valentine and Collins. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cWest line,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d from Halls Stream to the St. Lawrence near St. Regis, along the line of Valentine and Collins. To return to the narration of operations: The exploring line of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson, as directed by the treaty, was traced from the monument at the source of the St. Croix to the intersection of the St. John. The monument found at the source of the St. Croix, as described in the report of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson, and the course of their exploring line, was traced by blazes or marks upon the trees. An old line, cut out by the assistant surveyors of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson, was also found, which terminated about half a mile north of the South Branch of the Meduxnikeag, where, by records to which the undersigned referred, they ascertained that it had been abandoned because of its deviation from the exploring fine of Colonel Bouchette and Mr. Johnson. After the exploration and remarking of the north line it was cut out 30 feet wide. The same was afterwards done in all parts where the boundary passed through woodland. After thus opening the north line it was surveyed, and iron posts were erected at intervals to mark it. The general bearing of the line was rather to the west of the meridian of the monument at the source of the St. Croix. The precise line laid down by the undersigned was determined by successive courses, of which each was made to be as long as was convenient, provided it did not pass out of the opening of 30 feet. At each angle of deflection an iron monument was erected, and placed anglewise with the line. Other monuments were erected at the crossing of roads, rivers, and at every mile, commencing from the source of the St. Croix. Those which were not intended to mark angles of deflection were placed square with the line. At the intersection of the St. John by the north line the river is deep and broad. The boundary rims up the middle of the channel of the river, as indicated by the maps, dividing the islands as follows: No. 1. Ryan's Island United States. No. 2. King's Island United States. No. 3. Les Trois Isles United States. No. 4. La Septieme Isle United States. No. 5. Quissibis Great Britain. No. 6. La Grand Isle United States. No. 7. Thibideau's Islands United States. No. 8. Madawaska lslands Great Britain. No. 9. Joseph Michaud's three islands United States. No. 10. Pine Island Great Britain. No. 11. Baker's Turtle } Dagle's } islands Great Britain Fourth } Fifth } No. 12. Kennedy's Island Great Britain. No. 13. Crock's } Cranberry islands Great Britain. Gooseberry No. 14. Savage's Island United States. No. 15. Wheelock's Island - United States. No. 16. Caton's Island United States. No. 17. Honeywell's Island United States. No. 18. Savage and Johnson's Island United States. No. 19. Grew's Island United States. No. 20. Kendall's Island Great Britain. The islands were distributed to Great Britain or to the United States, as they were found to be on the fight or left of the deep channel. There was but one doubtful case, La Septieme Isle, and that was apportioned to the United States because the majority of the owners were ascertained to reside on the United States side of the river. Monuments were erected upon the islands, marking them for Great Britain or the United States, as the case may have been. After leaving the St. John the boundary enters the St. Francis, dividing the islands at the mouth of that river in the manner shown in the maps. It then runs up the St. Francis, through the middle of the lakes upon it, to the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook, the third large lake from the mouth of the river. At the outlet a large monument has been erected. In order to determine the point on the Northwest Branch to which the treaty directed that a straight line should be run from the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook, a survey of that stream was made, and also of the main St. John in the neighborhood of the mouth of the Northwest Branch, and a line was cut between the John and the point on the Northwest Branch ascertained by the survey to be miles in the nearest direction from it, and the distance was afterwards verified by chaining. It was ascertained also, in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, by a triangulation of the country toward the highlands dividing the waters of the St. Lawrence and of the St. John, that more than 7 miles intervened between the point selected on the Northwest Branch and the crest of the dividing ridge. A large iron monument was afterwards erected on the point thus selected, and the space around was cleared and sown with grass seed. It is a short distance below the outlet of Lake Ishaganalshegeck. The outlet of Lake Pohenagamook and the point on the Northwest Branch designated by the treaty having been thus ascertained and marked, in the spring of 1844 a straight line was run between them. Along that line, which passes entirely through forest, monuments were erected at every mile, at the crossings of the principal streams and rivers, and at the tops of those hills where a transit instrument had been set up to test the straightness of the line. As soon as the parallel of latitude Congress. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009c6 25 ' had been determined on the Southwest Branch, in the early part of the summer of 1844, a straight line was drawn from the boundary point on the Northwest Branch to a large monument erected on the left bank of the Southwest Branch where it is intersected by the parallel of latitude Congress.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d 6 25: The line so drawn crosses the Southwest Branch once before it reaches the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25 ', and at about half a mile distance from that parallel. There also a large monument has been set up on the left bank. From the intersection of the parallel Congress. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009c6 25 ' the boundary ascends the Southwest Branch, passes through a lake near its head, and so up a small stream which falls into the lake from the west to the source of that stream, which has been selected as the source of the Southwest Branch. On the Southwest Branch there are two principal forks, at each of which two monuments have been erected, one on each bank of the river immediately above the forks and upon the branch established as the boundary. The maps point out their positions. At the mouth of the small stream selected as the source of the Southwest Branch a monument has been erected upon a delta formed by two small outlets. Above those outlets three other monuments have been placed at intervals upon the same stream. Upon the crest of the dividing ridge, very close to the source of the Southwest Branch, a large monument has been erected. It is the first point in the highlands, and from it the boundary runs along the crest in a southerly direction, passing near to the southeastern shore of the Portage Lake, and so on to a large monument erected on a small eminence on the east side of the Kennebec road. Thence it passes through a dwelling house called Tachereau's, which was standing there at the time the line was run; so, by a tortuous course, it runs to the top of Sandy Stream Mountain; thence, inclining to the southwest, it runs over Hog Back the First, as shown in the maps; thence toward Hog Back the Second, which it leaves on the north side. Further on, at the head of Leech Lake, there is a stream which divides its waters and flows both into Canada and into the United States. The boundary has been made to run up that stream a short distance from the fork where the waters divide to a second fork; thence between the streams which unite to form that fork, and then to ascend again the dividing ridge. A monument has been erected at the fork first mentioned, where the waters divide. As the boundary approaches the valley of Spider River it bends to the southeast, and, by a wide circuit over high and steep hills, it turns the head of Spider River; thence it bends to the northwest until it approaches within about 4 miles of Lake Megantic; thence it turns again south, having the valley of Arnolds River on the right and of Dead River on the left. It leaves Gasford Mountain in Canada, threads its way over very high ground between the head of Arnolds River and the tributaries of the Magalloway; inclines then to the north, so to the west, over very rocky, mountainous, and difficult country, leaving Gipps Peak in the United States, and turns by a sharp angle at Saddle Back to the south. After that it again inclines to the west, and then to the south, and again to the west, and passes the head of the Connecticut. About 3 miles and a half east of the head of the Connecticut there is a division of waters similar to that described near Leech Lake. The boundary runs down a stream from near its source to the fork where it divides, and then again follows the dividing ridge. The spot is noted on the map. After the boundary has passed the head of the Connecticut it runs to the northwest, descending into very low, swampy ground between the heads of Indian Stream and the tributaries of the St. Francis. Thus it passes on, bending again to the south of west, over a high hill, to the source of Halls Stream. Iron monuments have been erected at intervals along the highlands from the source of the Southwest Branch of the St. John to the source of Halls Stream, the position of each of which is shown upon the maps. From the source of Halls Stream the boundary descends that river, dividing the islands, which are, however, merely unimportant alluvial deposits, in the manner indicated by the maps until it reaches the intersection of that stream by the line formerly run by Valentine and Collins as the forty-fifth degree of north latitude. At that point a large monument has been erected on the right and a small one on the left bank of the stream. Monuments have also been erected along the bank of this stream, as indicated on the maps. The line of Valentine and Collins was explored and found by the blazes still remaining in the original forest. Upon cutting into those blazes it was seen that deep seated in the tree there was a scar, the surface of the original blaze, slightly decayed, and upon counting the rings ( which indicate each year's growth of the tree ) it was found that the blazes dated back to 1772, 1773, and 1774. The line of Valentine and Collins was run in 1771, 1772, 1773, and 1774. The coincidence of the dates of the blazes with those of the above line, confirmed by the testimony of the people of the country, satisfied the undersigned that the line they had found was that mentioned in the treaty. Along this portion of the boundary, which is known as the forty-fifth degree of Valentine and Collins, and which extends from Halls Stream to St. Regis, there are several interruptions to the blazes in those parts where clearings have been made, and there the authentic marks of the precise situation of the old line have been lost. In those cases the undersigned have drawn the boundary line straight from the original blazes on the one side of a clearing to the original blazes on the other side of the same clearing. It can not be positively stated that the line as it has been traced through those clearings precisely coincides with the old line, but the undersigned believe that it does not differ materially from it; nor have they had the means of determining a nearer or a surer approximation. Along this line, at every point of deflection, an iron monument has been erected; also at the crossing of rivers, lakes, and roads. Those which mark deflections are placed, as on the\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d north line, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009canglewise with the line; all the others are placed square with it. The maps show the position of each. On the eastern shore of Lake Memphremagog an astronomical station was established, and on a large flat rock of granite, which happened to lie between the astronomical station and the boundary, was cut the following inscription: Capt: Robinson. Ast: Station 422 feet north. British Boundary Meridian Line. Commission Boundary Line 595 feet south August, 1845. A mark was cut upon the stone, as indicated by the dot upon the meridian line above, from which these measurements were made. At Rouses Point a monument of wrought stone was set up at the intersection of the boundary by the meridian of the transit instrument used there by Major Graham, and an inscription was cut upon it stating the latitude and longitude, the names of the observer and his assistant, the names of the commissioners, and the territories divided. To mark the position of the instruments used at the following astronomical stations along the west line, two monuments within a few feet of each other have been erected at each station, and they have been placed on the boundary line due north or south of the instrument, as the case may have been. The stations are: Lake Memphremagog, Richford, John McCoy's, Trout River. The boundary along the west line, though very far from being a straight line, is generally about half a mile north of the true parallel of latitude Coast 190 The from Halls Stream to Rouses Point. At about 28 miles west of Rouses Point it, however, crosses that parallel to the south until it reaches Chateaugay River, where it bends northward, and, crossing the parallel again about 4 miles east of St. Regis, it strikes the St. Lawrence 151 feet north of Coast 190 The. At that point a large monument has been erected on the bank of the St. Lawrence. Two large monuments have also been erected, one on either side of the river Richelieu near Rouses Point. No marks of the old line were to be found about St. Regis. It was therefore agreed to run a line due west from the last blaze which should be found in the woods on the east side of St. Regis. That blaze occurred about 1 mile east of the St. Regis River. The maps, which exhibit the boundary on a scale of 4 inches to 1 statute mile, consist of 62 consecutive sheets of antiquarian paper as constructed by the British and of 61 as constructed by the American commission. A general map has also been constructed on a scale of 8 miles to 1 inch by the British and of 10 miles to 1 inch by the American commission, upon which the before mentioned sheets are represented. The following portions of the boundary have been laid down by the British commission, on detached maps, on a scale of 12 inches to 1 mile, which have been signed by both commissioners: Grand Falls of the St. John, including the intersection of that river by the north line; islands of the St. John; the outlet of Lake Pohenagamook; the turning point of the boundary on the Northwest Branch of the St. John; the intersection of the Southwest Branch by the parallel of latitude 46 degrees 25 '; the source of the Southwest Branch; the source of Halls Stream; the intersection of Halls Stream by the west line; Rouses Point; St. Regis; Derby. But similar maps have not been prepared by the American commission, because during the interval between the finishing of the maps of the British commission and those of the American it was thought that the maps already constructed upon a scale of 4 inches to 1 mile represented the boundary with sufficient clearness and accuracy. The astronomical observations were begun at the Grand Falls early in June, 1843, and were carried up the St. John River to the Northwest Branch by a chain of stations, which, together with the results obtained, are tabulated in the appendix accompanying this report. From the valley of the St. John an astronomical connection was made with Quebec, and thence to Montreal, and so to Rouses Point. From Rouses Point a connection was obtained with Cambridge University, near Boston. The astronomical stations on the west line were: Intersection of Halls Stream by the west line, Lake Memphremagog, Richford, Rouses Point, John McCoy's, Trout River, St. Regis. Latitude was also obtained at an astronomical station established for the purpose at the head of the Connecticut. Volumes containing the astronomical observations of both commissions are herewith submitted. From them it will be observed that the results for absolute longitude obtained by the British and American astronomers do not agree. It being a difference in no way affecting the survey of the boundary line, the undersigned do not feel called upon to attempt to reconcile it. The data upon which those results are based may be seen in the volumes of observations accompanying this report. In the appendix will be found, in a tabular form, the following: An abstract of the survey of the boundary along the north line; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the southwest line; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the south line; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the highlands; an abstract of the survey of the boundary along the west line; the position of the monuments erected on the Southwest Branch of the St. John and on Halls Stream; the distribution of the islands of the St. John and the monuments on them; the guide lines and offsets run by each commission for the survey of the highlands; the azimuths of verification for the survey of the highlands; the latitudes and longitudes obtained from the astronomical observations; the comparative 512,977,32677,044,257 The obtained, and the methods used for the purpose. Upon comparing the maps of the two commissions it will be seen that the American commission numbers two monuments more than the British. Those are to be found, one on the\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Fourth Island, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cin the river St. John, and the other on the highlands between the source of the Southwest Branch of the river St. John and the Kennebec road. On the maps of the British commission representing the\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d west line \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cthe name of the town of\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Derby \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009chas been improperly placed north of the line instead of south of it. Also, on the same maps the direction of Salmon River, near the western extremity of the\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d west line, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009chas been incorrectly laid down from the boundary line northward. A direction has been given to it northeasterly instead of northwesterly. The above two corrections the British commissioner is authorized to make on his maps after his return to England. To avoid unnecessary delay in making their joint report, the undersigned have attached their signatures to the maps, although the lettering of some of the astronomical stations upon the maps of the American commission, as well as the alterations before mentioned in the maps of the British commission, are yet to be made; but in the maps of both the boundary has been laid down accurately and definitively, and the undersigned engage that it shall not be altered in any respect. In conclusion the undersigned have the honor to report that the line of boundary described in the foregoing statement has been run, marked, and surveyed, and the accompanying maps faithfully constructed from that survey. The undersigned take leave to add that the most perfect harmony has subsisted between the two commissions from first to last, and that no differences have arisen between the undersigned in the execution of the duties intrusted to them. Signed and sealed in duplicate, at the city of Washington, this 28th day of June, A. D. 1847. J. B. BUCKNALL ESTCOURT, Lieutenant-Colonel, Her Britannic Majesty's Commissioner. ALBERT SMITH, United States Commissioner. NOTE. The astronomical computations of the American commission not being completed, and it being unnecessary to defer the signing of the report on that account, the American commissioner engages to transmit them, with any other papers or tables not yet finished, as soon as they shall be so, to the British commissioner, through the American minister resident in London, to whom, upon delivery of the documents, the British commissioner will give a receipt, to be transmitted to the American commissioner. J. B. BUCKNALL ESTCOURT, Lieutenant-Colonel, H. B. M. Commissioner of Boundary. ALBERT SMITH United States Commissioner\",\n          \"GREAT BRITAIN 'S DEPARTURE FROM THE GOLD STANDARD THE PRESIDENT. I have been asked by two of your members to discuss something of the British demonetization or departure from the gold standard. I can only do that by way of background. I can not make a public statement in the matter. I think you will understand that this situation has been pending for a good many months. There has been a large amount of British investment in the United States, and that amount, estimated by the Department of Commerce, aggregates something over $ 1,500 million. That is not flight of capital but steadily increasing expenditures here which naturally affects the exchanges. It has taken place not only in the past few months but for some years back. That, of course, has affected the problem of exchange. There has been some piling up of immediate cash in our banks from that quarter. The course resolved upon by the British Government creates some temporary dislocations in the international world, but they are due more to the confusion arising out of readjustment of quotations and values than in their effect on the values of either securities or commodities. The first effect of the decrease in the gold value of the pound is a rise in prices of commodities in Great Britain, at least in all international commodities where the price is made by international action, such as in wheat and other raw materials. There is involved a large amount of transaction based on the readjustment of those prices. A certain amount of confusion comes out of that, and the effect on our commodity markets has been a decrease in prices. There has been a rise in price in England in consequence and our prices are practically unchanged yesterday and today. The fact that the pound is taken off its fixed value of $ 4.86 is not the abandonment of the gold standard even for the pound; as international commerce revolves in these days all transactions will be measured in some gold value, whether in dollars, francs, gulden, or any other of the fixed gold currencies. No transaction can take place unless it has some basis of measurement of that character. It really means that the fixed gold standard has been abandoned and a variable standard adopted which may change momentarily. But in any event all values in international commerce are bound to revolve on gold values or some measuring stick in gold. It is more or less a case of abandoning a fixed standard and adopting a variable one so far as international commerce is concerned. The effect in England will undoubtedly be to increase exports, which amounts to price reduction compared with the standard of measurement in gold, and it should act as a stimulant and thus should increase employment and increase the demand again for raw materials. Obviously, it amounts to a reduction in standards of living temporarily in those commodities which are imported, of course raw materials, but wages and rank will lag behind. Production costs will be lower, and consequently, exports will be stimulated. The tendency also may be to decrease imports to some extent especially for highly competitive goods. On the export side, the effect is not going to be very material on the United States because there are comparatively small volume of British and American goods which are highly competitive in neutral markets. A study made some time ago of the Argentine showed that there were only about 10 percent of the exports of the United States to the Argentine and correspondingly 10 percent of the British exports to the Argentine that were competitive. We are exporting goods which we can peculiarly produce to the best advantage, and it might mean competition in respect to that small fraction over toward the neutral market. But it would not be any appreciable volume. There might be some decrease in imports into Great Britain, especially in luxuries, but our trade with Great Britain consists largely of raw materials and manufactured goods. If there is stimulation of British exports our exports would be more likely to increase than decrease. I mention that only to indicate that the effect of it is not as far-reaching as some people may think. On the financial side there are no consequential balances of American banks in England. They will always have sufficient of their own capital. So there are no losses there of any consequence at all. All together the action, no doubt necessary on the British side, is not, we feel, going to have any great effect in the United States. The probabilities are that it will considerably improve the situation in England, and we will benefit in the long run. In any event, when there is a question pending over the world's economic life, the actual realization of it is much less severe on us than is the constant possibility of it such as has been the case for the past 3 or 4 months. All together if we are going to have an important economic shift it is better to have it over than to have it hanging about. You will realize also that this is not the first time that the pound has been off the gold basis. I do not know of any nation in the world which manages to maintain through its national life the gold value of its currency. There was a long period in the United States after the Civil War when we certainly could not maintain it. The pound was off the gold basis from some point in the war to 3, 4, or 5 years afterwards, but gradually the economic situation readjusts itself. These things are temporary and go back again to their original position. And that is all I have today\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

    "TJ_18081108_transcript = \"It would have been a source, fellow citizens, of much gratification, if our last communications from Europe had enabled me to inform you that the belligerent nations, whose disregard of neutral rights has been so destructive to our commerce, had become awakened to the duty and true policy of revoking their unrighteous edicts. That no means might be omitted to produce this salutary effect, I lost no time in availing myself of the act authorizing a suspension, in whole or in part, of the several embargo laws. Our ministers at London and Paris were instructed to explain to the respective governments there, our disposition to exercise the authority in such manner as would withdraw the pretext on which the aggressions were originally founded, and open a way for a renewal of that commercial intercourse which it was alleged on all sides had been reluctantly obstructed. As each of those governments had pledged its readiness to concur in renouncing a measure which reached its adversary through the incontestable rights of neutrals only, and as the measure had been assumed by each as a retaliation for an asserted acquiescence in the aggressions of the other, it was reasonably expected that the occasion would have been seized by both for evincing the sincerity of their profession, and for restoring to the commerce of the United States its legitimate freedom. The instructions to our ministers with respect to the different belligerents were necessarily modified with reference to their different circumstances, and to the condition annexed by law to the executive power of suspension, requiring a degree of security to our commerce which would not result from a repeal of the decrees of France. Instead of a pledge, therefore, of a suspension of the embargo as to her in case of such a repeal, it was presumed that a sufficient inducement might be found in other considerations, and particularly in the change produced by a compliance with our just demands by one belligerent, and a refusal by the other, in the relations between the other and the United States. To Great Britain, whose power on the ocean is so ascendant, it was deemed not inconsistent with that condition to state explicitly, that on her rescinding her orders in relation to the United States their trade would be opened with her, and remain shut to her enemy, in case of his failure to rescind his decrees also. From France no answer has been received, nor any indication that the requisite change in her decrees is contemplated. The favorable reception of the proposition to Great Britain was the less to be doubted, as her orders of council had not only been referred for their vindication to an acquiescence on the part of the United States no longer to be pretended, but as the arrangement proposed, while it resisted the illegal decrees of France, involved, moreover, substantially, the precise advantages professedly aimed at by the British orders. The arrangement has nevertheless been rejected.This candid and liberal experiment having thus failed, and no other event having occurred on which a suspension of the embargo by the executive was authorized, it necessarily remains in the extent originally given to it. We have the satisfaction, however, to reflect, that in return for the privations by the measure, and which our fellow citizens in general have borne with patriotism, it has had the important effects of saving our mariners and our vast mercantile property, as well as of affording time for prosecuting the defensive and provisional measures called for by the occasion. It has demonstrated to foreign nations the moderation and firmness which govern our councils, and to our citizens the necessity of uniting in support of the laws and the rights of their country, and has thus long frustrated those usurpations and spoliations which, if resisted, involve war; if submitted to, sacrificed a vital principle of our national independence.Under a continuance of the belligerent measures which, in defiance of laws which consecrate the rights of neutrals, overspread the ocean with danger, it will rest with the wisdom of Congress to decide on the course best adapted to such a state of things; and bringing with them, as they do, from every part of the Union, the sentiments of our constituents, my confidence is strengthened, that in forming this decision they will, with an unerring regard to the essential rights and interests of the nation, weigh and compare the painful alternatives out of which a choice is to be made. Nor should I do justice to the virtues which on other occasions have marked the character of our fellow citizens, if I did not cherish an equal confidence that the alternative chosen, whatever it may be, will be maintained with all the fortitude and patriotism which the crisis ought to inspire.The documents containing the correspondences on the subject of the foreign edicts against our commerce, with the instructions given to our ministers at London and Paris, are now laid before you.The communications made to Congress at their last session explained the posture in which the close of the discussion relating to the attack by a British ship of war on the frigate Chesapeake left a subject on which the nation had manifested so honorable a sensibility. Every view of what had passed authorized a belief that immediate steps would be taken by the British government for redressing a wrong, which, the more it was investigated, appeared the more clearly to require what had not been provided for in the special mission. It is found that no steps have been taken for the purpose. On the contrary, it will be seen, in the documents laid before you, that the inadmissible preliminary which obstructed the adjustment is still adhered to; and, moreover, that it is now brought into connection with the distinct and irrelative case of the orders in council. The instructions which had been given to our ministers at London with a view to facilitate, if necessary, the reparation claimed by the United States, are included in the documents communicated.Our relations with the other powers of Europe have undergone no material changes since your last session. The important negotiations with Spain, which had been alternately suspended and resumed, necessarily experience a pause under the extraordinary and interesting crisis which distinguished her internal situation.With the Barbary powers we continue in harmony, with the exception of an unjustifiable proceeding of the dey of Algiers toward our consul to that regency. Its character and circumstances are now laid before you, and will enable you to decide how far it may, either now or hereafter, call for any measures not within the limits of the executive authority.With our Indian neighbors the public peace has been steadily maintained. Some instances of individual wrong have, as at other times, taken place, but in nowise implicating the will of the nation. Beyond the Mississippi, the Iowas, the Sacs, and the Alabamas, have delivered up for trial and punishment individuals from among themselves accused of murdering citizens of the United States. On this side of the Mississippi, the Creeks are exerting themselves to arrest offenders of the same kind; and the Choctaws have manifested their readiness and desire for amicable and just arrangements respecting depredations committed by disorderly persons of their tribe. And, generally, from a conviction that we consider them as part of ourselves, and cherish with sincerity their rights and interests, the attachment of the Indian tribes is gaining strength daily -- is extending from the nearer to the more remote, and will amply requite us for the justice and friendship practised towards them. Husbandry and household manufacture are advancing among them, more rapidly with the southern than the northern tribes, from circumstances of soil and climate; and one of the two great divisions of the Cherokee nation have now under consideration to solicit the citizenship of the United States, and to be identified with us in laws and government, in such progressive manner as we shall think best.In consequence of the appropriations of the last session of Congress for the security of our seaport towns and harbors, such works of defence have been erected as seemed to be called for by the situation of the several places, their relative importance, and the scale of expense indicated by the amount of the appropriation. These works will chiefly be finished in the course of the present season, except at New York and New Orleans, where most was to be done; and although a great proportion of the last appropriation has been expended on the former place, yet some further views will be submitted by Congress for rendering its security entirely adequate against naval enterprise. A view of what has been done at the several places, and of what is proposed to be done, shall be communicated as soon as the several reports are received.Of the gun-boats authorized by the act of December last, it has been thought necessary to build only one hundred and three in the present year. These, with those before possessed, are sufficient for the harbors and waters exposed, and the residue will require little time for their construction when it is deemed necessary.Under the act of the last session for raising an additional military force, so many officers were immediately appointed as were necessary for carrying on the business of recruiting, and in proportion as it advanced, others have been added. We have reason to believe their success has been satisfactory, although such returns have not yet been received as enable me to present to you a statement of the numbers engaged.I have not thought it necessary in the course of the last season to call for any general detachments of militia or volunteers under the law passed for that purpose. For the ensuing season, however, they will require to be in readiness should their services be wanted. Some small and special detachments have been necessary to maintain the laws of embargo on that portion of our northern frontier which offered peculiar facilities for evasion, but these were replaced as soon as it could be done by bodies of new recruits. By the aid of these, and of the armed vessels called into actual service in other quarters, the spirit of disobedience and abuse which manifested itself early, and with sensible effect while we were unprepared to meet it, has been considerably repressed.Considering the extraordinary character of the times in which we live, our attention should unremittingly be fixed on the safety of our country. For a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well-organized and armed militia is their best security. It is, therefore, incumbent on us, at every meeting, to revise the condition of the militia, and to ask ourselves if it is prepared to repel a powerful enemy at every point of our territories exposed to invasion. Some of the States have paid a laudable attention to this object; but every degree of neglect is to be found among others. Congress alone have power to produce a uniform state of preparation in this great organ of defence; the interests which they so deeply feel in their own and their country's security will present this as among the most important objects of their deliberation.Under the acts of March 11th and April 23d, respecting arms, the difficulty of procuring them from abroad, during the present situation and dispositions of Europe, induced us to direct our whole efforts to the means of internal supply. The public factories have, therefore, been enlarged, additional machineries erected, and in proportion as artificers can be found or formed, their effect, already more than doubled, may be increased so as to keep pace with the yearly increase of the militia. The annual sums appropriated by the latter act, have been directed to the encouragement of private factories of arms, and contracts have been entered into with individual undertakers to nearly the amount of the first year's appropriation.The suspension of our foreign commerce, produced by the injustice of the belligerent powers, and the consequent losses and sacrifices of our citizens, are subjects of just concern. The situation into which we have thus been forced, has impelled us to apply a portion of our industry and capital to internal manufactures and improvements. The extent of this conversion is daily increasing, and little doubt remains that the establishments formed and forming will -- under the auspices of cheaper materials and subsistence, the freedom of labor from taxation with us, and of protecting duties and prohibitions -- become permanent. The commerce with the Indians, too, within our own boundaries, is likely to receive abundant aliment from the same internal source, and will secure to them peace and the progress of civilization, undisturbed by practices hostile to both.The accounts of the receipts and expenditures during the year ending on the 30th day of September last, being not yet made up, a correct statement will hereafter be transmitted from the Treasury. In the meantime, it is ascertained that the receipts have amounted to near eighteen millions of dollars, which, with the eight millions and a half in the treasury at the beginning of the year, have enabled us, after meeting the current demands and interest incurred, to pay two millions three hundred thousand dollars of the principal of our funded debt, and left us in the treasury, on that day, near fourteen millions of dollars. Of these, five millions three hundred and fifty thousand dollars will be necessary to pay what will be due on the first day of January next, which will complete the reimbursement of the eight per cent. stock. These payments, with those made in the six years and a half preceding, will have extinguished thirty-three millions five hundred and eighty thousand dollars of the principal of the funded debt, being the whole which could be paid or purchased within the limits of the law and our contracts; and the amount of principal thus discharged will have liberated the revenue from about two millions of dollars of interest, and added that sum annually to the disposable surplus. The probable accumulation of the surpluses of revenue beyond what can be applied to the payment of the public debt, whenever the freedom and safety of our commerce shall be restored, merits the consideration of Congress. Shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults? Shall the revenue be reduced? Or shall it rather be appropriated to the improvements of roads, canals, rivers, education, and other great foundations of prosperity and union, under the powers which Congress may already possess, or such amendment of the constitution as may be approved by the States? While uncertain of the course of things, the time may be advantageously employed in obtaining the powers necessary for a system of improvement, should that be thought best.Availing myself of this the last occasion which will occur of addressing the two houses of the legislature at their meeting, I cannot omit the expression of my sincere gratitude for the repeated proofs of confidence manifested to me by themselves and their predecessors since my call to the administration, and the many indulgences experienced at their hands. The same grateful acknowledgments are due to my fellow citizens generally, whose support has been my great encouragement under all embarrassments. In the transaction of their business I cannot have escaped error. It is incident to our imperfect nature. But I may say with truth, my errors have been of the understanding, not of intention; and that the advancement of their rights and interests has been the constant motive for every measure. On these considerations I solicit their indulgence. Looking forward with anxiety to their future destinies, I trust that, in their steady character unshaken by difficulties, in their love of liberty, obedience to law, and support of the public authorities, I see a sure guaranty of the permanence of our republic; and retiring from the charge of their affairs, I carry with me the consolation of a firm persuasion that Heaven has in store for our beloved country long ages to come of prosperity and happiness.\""

vice president my fellow democrats and my fellow americans thank you for your nomination i dont know if i can find a fancy way to say this but i accept so many have contributed to the record we have made for the american people but one above all my partner my friend and the best vice president in our history al gore tonight i thank the city of chicago its great mayor and its wonderful people for this magnificent convention i love chicago for many reasons for your powerful spirit your sports teams your lively politics but most of all for the love and light of my life chicagos daughter hillary four years ago you and i set forth on a journey to bring our vision to our country to keep the american dream alive for all who were willing to work for it to make our american community stronger to keep america the worlds strongest force for peace and freedom and prosperity four years ago with high unemployment stagnant wages crime welfare and the deficit on the rise with a host of unmet challenges and a rising tide of cynicism i told you about a place i was born and i told you that i still believed in a place called hope well for four years now to realize our vision we have pursued a simple but profound strategy opportunity for all responsibility from all a strong united american community four days ago as you were making your way here i began a train ride to make my way to chicago through americas heartland i wanted to see the faces i wanted to hear the voices of the people for whom i have worked and fought these last four years and did i ever see them i met an ingenious business woman who was once on welfare in west virginia a brave police officer shot and paralyzed now a civic leader in kentucky an autoworker in ohio once unemployed now proud to be working in the oldest auto plant in america to help make america number one in auto production again for the first time in years i met a grandmother fighting for her grandsons environment in michigan and i stood with two wonderful little children proudly reading from their favorite book the little engine that could at every stop large and exuberant crowds greeted me and maybe more important when we just rolled through little towns there were always schoolchildren there waving their american flags all of them believing in america and its future i would not have missed that trip for all the world for that trip showed me that hope is back in america we are on the right track to the 21st century look at the facts just look at the facts million americans now living in a home of their own for the first time hundreds of thousands of women have started their own new businesses more minorities own businesses than ever before record numbers of new small businesses and exports look at whats happened we have the lowest combined rates of unemployment inflation and home mortgages in years look at what happened million new jobs over half of them highwage jobs million workers getting the raise they deserve with the minimum wage law million people now having protection in their health insurance because the kennedykassebaum bill says you cant lose your insurance anymore when you change jobs even if somebody in your family has been sick million americans with more pension security a tax cut for million of our hardest working hardest pressed americans and all small businesses million americans \\u00e2 million of them \\u00e2 taking advantage of the family and medical leave law so they can be good parents and good workers ten million students have saved money on their college loans we are making our democracy work we have also passed political reform the lineitem veto the motor voter bill tougher registration laws for lobbyists making congress live under the laws they impose on the private sector stopping unfunded mandates to state and local government weve come a long way weve got one more thing to do will you help me get campaign finance reform in the next four years applause we have increased our investments in research and technology we have increased investments in breast cancer research dramatically we are developing a supercomputer \\u00e2 a supercomputer that will do more calculating in a second than a person with a hand held calculator can do in 30years more rapid development of drugs to deal with hiv and aids and moving them to the market quicker have almost doubled life expectancy in only four years and we are looking at no limit in sight to that well keep going until normal life is returned to people who deal with this our country is still the strongest force for peace and freedom on earth on issues that once before tore us apart we have changed the old politics of washington for too long leaders in washington asked whos to blame but we asked what are we going to do on crime were putting 100police on the streets we made \\u00e2three strikes and youre out\\u00e2 the law of the land we stopped 60felons fugitives and stalkers from getting handguns under the brady bill we banned assault rifles we supported tougher punishment and prevention programs to keep our children from drugs and gangs and violence four years now \\u00e2 for four years now \\u00e2 the crime rate in america has gone down on welfare we worked with states to launch a quiet revolution today there are million fewer people on welfare than there were the day i took the oath of office we are moving people from welfare to work we have increased child support collections by percent the federal work force is the smallest it has been since john kennedy and the deficit has come down for four years in a row for the first time since before the civil war down percent on the way to zero we will do it we are on the right track to the 21st century we are on the right track but our work is not finished what should we do first let us consider how to proceed again i say the question is no longer whos to blame but what to do i believe that bob dole and jack kemp and ross perot love our country and they have worked hard to serve it it is legitimate even necessary to compare our record with theirs our proposals for the future with theirs and i expect them to make a vigorous effort to do the same but i will not attack i will not attack them personally or permit others to do it in this party if i can prevent it my fellow americans this must be \\u00e2 this must be a campaign of ideas not a campaign of insults the american people deserve it now heres the main idea i love and revere the rich and proud history of america and i am determined to take our best traditions into the future but with all respect we do not need to build a bridge to the past we need to build a bridge to the future and that is what i commit to you to do so tonight tonight let us resolve to build that bridge to the 21st century to meet our challenges and protect our values let us build a bridge to help our parents raise their children to help young people and adults to get the education and training they need to make our streets safer to help americans succeed at home and at work to break the cycle of poverty and dependence to protect our environment for generations to come and to maintain our world leadership for peace and freedom let us resolve to build that bridge tonight my fellow americans i ask all of our fellow citizens to join me and to join you in building that bridge to the 21st century four years from now just four years from now \\u00e2 think of it \\u00e2 we begin a new century full of enormous possibilities we have to give the american people the tools they need to make the most of their god given potential we must make the basic bargain of opportunity and responsibility available to all americans not just a few that is the promise of the democratic party that is the promise of america i want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which we expand opportunity through education where computers are as much a part of the classroom as blackboards where highly trained teachers demand peak performance from our students where every 8yearold can point to a book and say \\u00e2i can read it myself\\u00e2 by the year 2000 the single most critical thing we can do is to give every single american who wants it the chance to go to college we must make two years of college just as universal in four years as a high school education is today and we can do it we can do it and we should cut taxes to do it i propose a 1ayear tuition tax credit for americans a hope scholarship for the first two years of college to make the typical community college education available to every american i believe every working family ought also to be able to deduct up to 10in college tuition costs per year for education after that i believe the families of this country ought to be able to save money for college in a taxfree ira save it year in and year out withdraw it for college education without penalty we should not tax middle income americans for the money they spend on college well get the money back down the road many times over i want to say here before i go further that these tax cuts and every other one i mention tonight are all fully paid for in my balanced budget plan linebyline dimebydime and they focus on education now one thing so many of our fellow americans are learning is that education no longer stops on graduation day i have proposed a new \\u00e2gi bill\\u00e2 for american workers a 2grant for unemployed and underemployed americans so that they can get the training and the skills they need to go back to work at better paying jobs good highskilled jobs for a good future but we must demand excellence at every level of education we must insist that our students learn the old basics we learned and the new basics they have to know for the next century tonight let us set a clear national goal all children should be able to read on their own by the third grade when percent of our 8yearolds can not read as well as they should we have to do something i want to send 30reading specialists and national service corps members to mobilize a voluntary army of one million reading tutors for third graders all across america they will teach our young children to read let me say to our parents you have to lead the way every tired night you spend reading a book to your child will be worth it many times over i know that hillary and i still talk about the books we read to chelsea when we were so tired we could hardly stay awake we still remember them and more important so does she but were going to help the parents of this country make every child able to read for himself or herself by the age of 8 by the third grade do you believe we can do that applause will you help us do that applause we must give parents all parents the right to choose which public school their children will attend and to let teachers form new charter schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job we must keep our schools open late so that young people have someplace to go and something to say yes to and stay off the street we must require that our students pass tough tests to keep moving up in school a diploma has to mean something when they get out we should reward teachers that are doing a good job remove those who dont measure up but in every case never forget that none of us would be here tonight if it werent for our teachers i know i wouldnt we ought to lift them up not tear them down we need schools that will take our children into the next century we need schools that are rebuilt and modernized with an unprecedented commitment from the national government to increase school construction and with every single library and classroom in america connected to the information superhighway by the year 2000 now folks if we do these things every 8yearold will be able to read every 12yearold will be able to log in on the internet every 18yearold will be able to go to college and all americans will have the knowledge they need to cross that bridge to the 21st century i want to build a bridge to the 21st century in which we create a strong and growing economy to preserve the legacy of opportunity for the next generation by balancing our budget in a way that protects our values and ensuring that every family will be able to own and protect the value of their most important asset their home tonight let us proclaim to the american people we will balance the budget and let us also proclaim we will do it in a way that preserves medicare medicaid education the environment the integrity of our pensions the strength of our people now last year when the republican congress sent me a budget that violated those values and principles i vetoed it and i would do it again tomorrow i could never allow cuts that devastate education for our children that pollute our environment that end the guarantee of health care for those who are served under medicaid that end our duty or violate our duty to our parents through medicare i just couldnt do that as long as be president ill never let it happen and it doesnt matter if they try again as they did before to use the blackmail threat of a shutdown of the federal government to force these things on the american people we didnt let it happen before we wont let it happen again of course there is a better answer to this dilemma we could have the right kind of balanced budget with a new congress a democratic congress i want to balance the budget with real cuts in government in waste i want a plan that invests in education as mine does in technology and yes in research as christopher reeve so powerfully reminded us we must do and my plan gives americans tax cuts that will help our economy to grow i want to expand iras so that young people can save taxfree to buy a first home tonight i propose a new tax cut for home ownership that says to every middle income working family in this country if you sell your home you will not have to pay a capital gains tax on it ever not ever i want every american to be able to hear those beautiful words \\u00e2welcome home\\u00e2 let me say again every tax cut i call for tonight is targeted its responsible and it is paid for within my balanced budget plan my tax cuts will not undermine our economy they will speed economic growth we should cut taxes for the family sending a child to college for the worker returning to college for the family saving to buy a home or for long term health care and a 500perchild credit for middle income families raising their children who need help with child care and what the children will do after school that is the right way to cut taxes profamily proeducation proeconomic growth now our opponents have put forward a very different plan a risky billion tax scheme that will force them to ask for even bigger cuts in medicare medicaid education and the environment than they passed and i vetoed last year but even then they will not cover the costs of their scheme so that even then this plan will explode the deficit which will increase interest rates by two percent according to their own estimates last year it will require huge cuts in the very investments we need to grow and to grow together and at the same time slow down the economy you know what higher interest rates mean to you it means a higher mortgage payment a higher car payment a higher credit card payment to our economy it means business people will not borrow as much money invest as much money create as many new jobs create as much wealth raise as many wages do we really want to make that same mistake all over again do we really want to stop economic growth again do we really want to start piling up another mountain of debt do we want to bring back the recession of and 92 do we want to weaken our bridge to the 21st century of course we dont we have an obligation you and i to leave our children a legacy of opportunity not a legacy of debt our budget would be balanced today we would have a surplus today if we didnt have to make the interest payments on the debt run up in the years before the vii since administration took office so let me say this is one of those areas in which i respectfully disagree with my opponent i dont believe we should bet the farm and i certainly dont believe we should bet the country we should stay on the right track to the 21st century opportunity alone is not enough i want to build an america in the 21st century in which all americans take personal responsibility for themselves their families their communities and their country i want our nation to take responsibility to make sure that every single child can look out the window in the morning and see a whole community getting up and going to work we want these young people to know the thrill of the first paycheck the challenge of starting that first business the pride in following in a parents footsteps the welfare reform law i signed last week gives america a chance but not a guarantee to have that kind of new beginning to have a new social bargain with the poor guaranteeing health care child care and nutrition for the children but requiring abovementioned parents to work for the income now i say to all of you whether you supported the law or opposed it but especially to those who supported it we have a responsibility we have a moral obligation to make sure the people who are being required to work have the opportunity to work we must make sure the jobs are there there should be one million new jobs for welfare recipients by the year 2000 states under this law can now take the money that was spent on the welfare check and use it to help businesses provide paychecks i challenge every state to do it soon i propose also to give businesses a tax credit for every person hired off welfare and kept employed i propose to offer private job placement firms a bonus for every welfare recipient they place in a job who stays in it and more important i want to help communities put welfare recipients to work right now without delay repairing schools making their neighborhoods clean and safe making them shine again theres lots of work to be done out there our cities can find ways to put people to work and bring dignity and strength back to these families my fellow americans i have spent an enormous amount of time with our dear friend the late ron brown and with secretary kantor and others opening markets for america around the world and be proud of every one we opened but let us never forget the greatest untapped market for american enterprise is right here in america in the inner cities in the rural areas who have not felt this recovery with investment and business and jobs they can become our partners in the future and its a great opportunity we ought not to pass up i propose more empowerment zones like the one we have right here in chicago to draw business into poor neighborhoods i propose more community development banks like the south shore bank right here in chicago to help people in those neighborhoods start their own small businesses more jobs more incomes new markets for america right here at home making welfare reform a reality applause now folks you cheered \\u00e2 and i thank you \\u00e2 but the government can only do so much the private sector has to provide most of these jobs so i want to say again tonight i challenge every business person in america who has ever complained about the failure of the welfare system to try to hire somebody off welfare and try hard applause thank you after all the welfare system you used to complain about is not here anymore there is no more \\u00e2whos to blame\\u00e2 on welfare now the only question is what to do and we all have a responsibility especially those who have criticized what was passed and who have asked for a change and who have the ability to give poor people a chance to grow and support their families i want to build a bridge to the 21st century that ends the permanent under class that lifts up the poor and ends their isolation their exile and theyre not forgotten anymore applause thank you i want to build a bridge to the 21st century where our children are not killing other children anymore where childrens lives are not shattered by violence at home or in the schoolyard where a generation of young people are not left to raise themselves on the streets with more police and punishment and prevention the crime rate has dropped for four years in a row now but we can not rest because we know its still too high we can not rest until crime is a shocking exception to our daily lives not news as usual will you stay with me until we reach that good day applause my fellow americans we all owe a great debt to sarah and jim brady and be glad they took their wrong turn and wound up in chicago i was glad to see that it is to them we owe the good news that 60felons fugitives and stalkers couldnt get handguns because of the brady bill but not a single hunter in arkansas or new hampshire or illinois or anyplace else missed a hunting season but now i say we should extend the brady bill because anyone who has committed an act of domestic violence against a spouse or a child should not buy a gun and we must ban those tinplate bullets they are designed for one reason only to kill police officers we ask the police to keep us safe we owe it to them to help keep them safe while they do their job for us we should pass a victims rights constitutional amendment because victims deserve to be heard they need to know when an assailant is released they need to know these things and the only way to guarantee them is through a constitutional amendment we have made a great deal of progress even the crime rate among young people is finally coming down so it is very very painful to me that drug use among young people is up drugs nearly killed my brother when he was a young man and i hate them he fought back hes here tonight with his wife his little boy is here and be really proud of him but i learned something \\u00e2 i learned something in going through that long nightmare with our family and i can tell you something has happened to some of our young people they simply dont think these drugs are dangerous anymore or they think the risk is acceptable so beginning with our parents and without regard to our party we have to renew our energy to teach this generation of young people the hard cold truth drugs are deadly drugs are wrong drugs can cost you your life general barry mccaffrey the fourstar general who led our fight against drugs in latin america now leads our crusade against drugs at home stopping more drugs at our borders cracking down on those who sell them and most important of all pursuing a national antidrug strategy whose primary aim is to turn our children away from drugs i call on congress to give him every cent of funding we have requested for this strategy and to do it now there is more we will do we should say to parolees we will test you for drugs if you go back on them we will send you back to jail we will say to gangs we will break you with the same antiracketeering law we used to put mob bosses in jail youre not going to kill our kids anymore or turn them into murderers before theyre teenagers my fellow americans if were going to build that bridge to the 21st century we have to make our children free free of the vise grip of guns and gangs and drugs free to build lives of hope i want to build a bridge to the 21st century with a strong american community beginning with strong families an america where all children are cherished and protected from destructive forces where parents can succeed at home and at work everywhere ive gone in america people come up and talk to me about their struggle with the demands of work and their desire to do a better job with their children the very first person i ever saw fight that battle was here with me four years ago and tonight i miss her very very much my irrepressible hard working always optimistic mother did the best she could for her brother and me often against very stiff odds i learned from her just how much love and determination can overcome but from her and from our life i also learned that no parent can do it alone and no parent should have to she had the kind of help every parent deserves from our neighbors our friends our teachers our pastors our doctors and so many more you know when i started out in public life with a lot of my friends from the arkansas delegation down here there used to be a saying from time to time that every man who runs for public office will claim that he was born in a log cabin he built with his own hands laughter well my mother knew better and she made sure i did too long before she even met hillary my mother knew it takes a village and she was grateful for the support she got as tipper gore and hillary said on tuesday we have all of us in our administration worked hard to support families in raising their children and succeeding at work but we must do more we should extend the family and medical leave law to give parents some time off to take their children to regular doctors appointments or attend those parentteacher conferences at school that is a key determination of their success we should pass a flextime law that allows employees to take their overtime pay in money or in time off depending on whats better for their family the fda has adopted new measures to reduce advertising and sales of cigarettes to children the vice president spoke so movingly of it last night but let me remind you my fellow americans that is very much an issue in this election because that battle is far from over and the two candidates have different views i pledge to americas parents that i will see this effort all the way through working with the entertainment industry were giving parents the vchip tv shows are being rated for content so parents will be able to make a judgment about whether their small children should see them and three hours of quality childrens programming every week on every network are on the way the kennedykassebaum law says every american can keep his or her health insurance if they have to change jobs even if someone in their family has been sick that is a very important thing but tonight we should spell out the next steps the first thing we ought to do is to extend the benefits of health care to people who are unemployed i propose in my balanced budget plan paid for to help unemployed families keep their health insurance for up to six months a parent may be without a job but no child should be without a doctor and let me say again as the first lady did on tuesday we should protect mothers and newborn babies from being forced out of the hospital in less than hours we respect the individual conscience of every american on the painful issue of abortion but believe as a matter of law that this decision should be left to a woman her conscience her doctor and her god abortion should not only be safe and legal it should be rare thats why i helped to establish and support a national effort to reduce outof wedlock teen pregnancy and that is why we must promote adoption last week the minimum wage bill i signed contained a 5credit to families who adopt children even more if the children have disabilities it put an end to racial discrimination in the adoption process it was a good thing for america my fellow americans already there are tens of thousands of children out there who need a good home with loving parents i hope more of them will find it now i want to build a bridge to the 21st century with a clean and safe environment we are making our food safer from pesticides were protecting our drinking water and our air from poisons we saved yellowstone from mining we established the largest national park south of alaska in the mojave desert in california we are working to save the precious florida everglades and when the leaders of this congress invited the polluters into the back room to roll back years of environmental protections that both parties had always supported i said no but we must do more today million children live within just four miles of a toxic waste dump we have cleaned up of those dumps in the last three years more than in the previous years combined in the next four years we propose to clean up more twothirds of all that are left and the most dangerous ones our children should grow up next to parks not poison we should make it a crime even to attempt to pollute we should freeze the serious polluters property until they clean up the problems they create we should make it easier for families to find out about toxic chemicals in their neighborhoods so they can do more to protect their own children these are the things that we must do to build that bridge to the 21st century my fellow americans i want to build a bridge to the 21st century that makes sure we are still the nation with the worlds strongest defense that our foreign policy still advances the values of our american community in the community of nations our bridge to the future must include bridges to other nations because we remain the worlds indispensable nation to advance prosperity peace and freedom and to keep our own children safe from the dangers of terror and weapons of mass destruction we have helped to bring democracy to haiti and peace to bosnia now the peace signed on the white house lawn between the israelis and the palestinians must embrace more of israels neighbors the deep desire for peace that hillary and i felt when we walked the streets of belfast and derry must become real for all the people of northern ireland and cuba must finally join the community of democracies nothing in our lifetime has been more heartening than when people of the former soviet union and central europe broke the grip of communism we have aided their progress and i am proud of it and i will continue our strong partnership with a democratic russia and we will bring some of central europes new democracies into nato so that they will never question their own freedom in the future our american exports are at record levels in the next four years we have to break down even more barriers to them reaching out to latin america to africa to other countries in asia making sure that our workers and our products the worlds finest have the benefit of free and fair trade in the last four years we have frozen north koreas nuclear weapons program and i am proud to say that tonight there is not a single russian nuclear missile pointed at an american child now we must enforce and ratify without delay measures that further reduce nuclear arsenals banish poison gas and ban nuclear tests once and for all we have made investments new investments in our most important defense asset our magnificent men and women in uniform by the year we also will have increased funding to modernize our weapons systems by percent these commitments will make sure that our military remains the best trained best equipped fighting force in the entire world we are developing a sensible national missile defense but we must not not now not by the year 2000 squander billion on an unproved ineffective star wars program that could be obsolete tomorrow we are fighting terrorism on all fronts with a three pronged strategy first we are working to rally a world coalition with zero tolerance for terrorism just this month i signed a law imposing harsh sanctions on foreign companies that invest in key sectors of the iranian and libyan economies as long as iran trains supports and protects terrorists as long as libya refuses to give up the people who blew up pan am 103 they will pay a price from the united states second we must give law enforcement the tools they need to take the fight to terrorists we need new laws to crack down on money laundering and to prosecute and punish those who commit violent acts against american citizens abroad to add chemical markers or taggants to gunpowder used in bombs so we can crack the bombmakers to extend the same power police now have against organized crime to save lives by tapping all the phones that terrorists use terrorists are as big a threat to our future perhaps bigger than organized crime why should we have two different standards for a common threat to the safety of america and our children we need in short the laws that congress refused to pass and i ask them again please as an american not a partisan matter pass these laws now third we will improve airport and air travel security i have asked the vice president to establish a commission and report back to me on ways to do this but now we will install the most sophisticated bomb detection equipment in all our major airports we will search every airplane flying to or from america from another nation every flight every cargo hold every cabin every time my fellow democrats and my fellow americans i know that in most election seasons foreign policy is not a matter of great interest in the debates in the barbershops and the cafes of america on the plant floors and at the bowling alleys but there are times there are times when only america can make the difference between war and peace between freedom and repression between life and death we can not save all the worlds children but we can save many of them we can not become the worlds policeman but where our values and our interests are at stake and where we can make a difference we must act and we must lead that is our job and we are better stronger and safer because we are doing it my fellow americans let me say one last time we can only build our bridge to the 21st century if we build it together and if were willing to walk arm in arm across that bridge together i have spent so much of your time that you gave me these last four years to be your president worrying about the problems of bosnia the middle east northern ireland rwanda burundi what do these places have in common people are killing each other and butchering children because they are different from one another they share the same piece of land but they are different from one another they hate their race their tribe their ethnic group their religion we have seen the terrible terrible price that people pay when they insist on fighting and killing their neighbors over their differences in our own country we have seen america pay a terrible price for any form of discrimination and we have seen us grow stronger as we have steadily let more and more of our hatreds and our fears go as we have given more and more of our people the chance to live their dreams that is why the flame of our statue of liberty like the olympic flame carried all across america by thousands of citizen heroes will always always burn brighter than the fires that burn our churches our synagogues our mosques \\u00e2 always look around this hall tonight and to our fellow americans watching on television you look around this hall tonight \\u00e2 there is every conceivable difference here among the people who are gathered if we want to build that bridge to the 21st century we have to be willing to say loud and clear if you believe in the values of the constitution the bill of rights the declaration of independence if youre willing to work hard and play by the rules you are part of our family and were proud to be with you applause you cheer now because you know this is true you know this is true when you walk out of this hall think about it live by it we still have too many americans who give in to their fears of those who are different from them not so long ago swastikas were painted on the doors of some africanamerican members of our special forces at fort bragg folks for those of you who dont know what they do the special forces are just what the name says they are special forces if i walk off this stage tonight and call them on the telephone and tell them to go halfway around the world and risk their lives for you and be there by tomorrow at noon they will do it they do not deserve to have swastikas on their doors so look around here look around here old or young healthy as a horse or a person with a disability that hasnt kept you down man or woman native american native born immigrant straight or gay whatever the test ought to be i believe in the constitution the bill of rights and the declaration of independence i believe in religious liberty i believe in freedom of speech i believe in working hard and playing by the rules be showing up for work tomorrow be building that bridge to the 21st century that ought to be the test my fellow americans nights from tonight the american people will face once again a critical moment of decision were going to choose the last president of the 20th century and the first president of the 21st century but the real choice is not that the real choice is whether we will build a bridge to the future or a bridge to the past about whether we believe our best days are still out there or our best days are behind us about whether we want a country of people all working together or one where youre on your own let us commit ourselves this night to rise up and build the bridge we know we ought to build all the way to the 21st century let us have faith american faith that we are not leaving our greatness behind were going to carry it right on with us into that new century a century of new challenge and unlimited promise let us in short do the work that is before us so that when our time here is over we will all watch the sun go down as we all must and say truly we have prepared our children for the dawn my fellow americans after these four good hard years i still believe in a place called hope a place called america thank you god bless you and good night\",\n          \"mr chairman and my fellow citizens in accepting the great honor that you have brought to me i desire to speak so simply and so plainly that every man and woman in the united states who may hear or read my words can not misunderstand the last years have been a time of unparalleled economic calamity they have been years of greater suffering and hardship than any which have come to the american people since the aftermath of the civil war as we look back over these troubled years we realize that we have passed through two different stages of dislocation and distress before the storm broke we were steadily gaining in prosperity our wounds from the war were rapidly healing advances in science and invention had opened vast vistas of new progress being prosperous we became optimistic all of us from optimism some of us went to overexpansion in anticipation of the future and from overexpansion to reckless speculation in the soil poisoned by speculation grew those ugly weeds of waste exploitation and abuse of financial power in this overproduction and speculative mania we marched with the rest of the whole world then years ago came retribution by the inevitable worldwide slump in the consumption of goods in prices and employment at that juncture it was the normal penalty for a reckless boom such as we have witnessed a score of times in our national history through such depressions we have always passed safely after a relatively short period of losses of hardship and of adjustment we have adopted policies in the government which were fitting to the situation gradually the country began to right itself eighteen months ago there was a solid basis for hope that recovery was in sight then there came to us a new calamity a blow from abroad of such dangerous character as to strike at the very safety of the republic the countries of europe proved unable to withstand the stress of the depression the memories of the world had ignored the fact that the insidious diseases left by the great war had not been cured the skill and intelligence of millions in europe had been blotted out by battle by disease and by starvation stupendous burdens of national debt had been built up poisoned springs of political instability lay in the treaties which closed the war fear and hates held armament to double those before the great conflict governments were fallaciously seeking to build back by enlarged borrowing by subsidizing industry and employment from taxes that slowly sapped the savings upon which industry and rejuvenated commerce must be built under these strains the financial systems of foreign countries crashed one by one new blows with decreasing world consumption of goods and from failing financial systems rained upon our people we are a part of the world the disturbance of whose remotest populations affects our financial system our employment our markets and the prices of our farm products thus beginning months ago the worldwide storm grew rapidly to hurricane force and the greatest economic emergency in all the history of the world unexpected unforeseen violent shocks with every month brought new dangers and new emergencies to our country fear and apprehension gripped the heart of our people in every village and city if we look back over the disasters of these years we find that three quarter of the population of the globe has suffered from the flames of revolution many nations have been subject to constant change and vacillation of government others have resorted to dictatorship or tyranny in desperate attempts to preserve some kind of social order i may pause for one short illustration of the character of one single destructive force arising from these causes which we have been compelled to meet that was its effect upon our financial structure foreign countries in the face of their own failures the failures of their neighbors not believing that we had either the courage or the ability or the strength to meet this crisis withdrew from the united states over 2million including a billion of gold our own alarmed citizens withdrew over 1million of currency from our banks into hoarding these actions combined with the fears that they generated caused a shrinkage of credit available for the conduct of industry and commerce by several times even these vast sums its visible expression was the failures of banks and business the demoralization of security and real property values of the commodity prices and of employment and that was but one of the invading forces of destruction that we have been compelled to meet in the last months two courses were open to us we might have done nothing that would have been utter ruin instead we met the situation with proposals to private business and to the congress of the most gigantic program of economic defense and counterattack ever evolved in the history of the republic we put that program in action our measures have repelled these attacks of fear and panic we have maintained the financial integrity of the government we have cooperated to restore and stabilize the situation abroad as a nation we have paid every dollar demanded of us we have used the credit of the government to aid and protect our institutions both public and private we have provided methods and assurances that none suffer from hunger or cold amongst our people we have instituted measures to assist our farmers and our homeowners we have created vast agencies for employment above all we have maintained the sanctity of the principles upon which this republic has grown great in a large sense the test of the success of our program is simple our people while suffering great hardships have been and will be cared for in the long view our institutions have been sustained intact and are now functioning with increasing confidence for the future as a nation we are undefeated and unafraid and again above all government by the people has not been defiled with the humility of one who by necessity has stood in the midst of this storm i can say with pride that the distinction for these accomplishments belongs not to the government or to any individual it is due to the intrepid soul of our people it is to their character their fortitude their initiative and their courage that we owe these results we of this generation did not build this great ship of state but the policies that we have inaugurated have protected and aided its navigation in this terrible storm these policies and programs have not been partisan i gladly give tribute to those members of the democratic party in the congress whose patriotic cooperation against factional and demagogic opposition has assisted in a score of great undertakings i likewise give credit to democratic as well as republican leaders among our citizens for their cooperation and their help a record of these dangers and these policies of the last years will be set down in the books much of it is of interest only to history our interest now is in the future i dwell upon these policies and these programs and problems only where they illustrate the questions of the day and our course for the future as a government and as a people we still have much to do we must continue the building of our measures of restoration we must profit by the lessons of this experience before i enter upon a discussion of these policies i wish to say something of my conception of the relations of our government to the people and the responsibilities of both particularly as applied to these times the spirit and the devising of this government by the people was to sustain a dual purpose on the one hand to protect our people amongst nations and in domestic emergencies by great national power and on the other to preserve individual liberty and freedom through local self government the function of the federal government in these times is to use its reserve powers and its strength for the protection of citizens and local governments by the support to our institutions against forces beyond their control it is not the function of the government to relieve individuals of their responsibilities to their neighbors or to relieve private institutions of their responsibilities to the public or the local government to the states or the responsibilities of state governments to the federal government in giving that protection and that aid the federal government must insist that all of them exert their responsibilities in full it is vital that the programs of the government shall not compete with or replace any of them but shall add to their initiative and to their strength it is vital that by the use of public revenues and public credit in emergencies that the nation shall be strengthened and not weakened and in all these emergencies and crises and in all our future policies we must also preserve the fundamental principles of our social and our economic system that system was rounded upon a conception of ordered freedom the test of that freedom is that there should be maintained an equality of opportunity to every individual so that he may achieve for himself the best to which his character ability and ambition entitle him it is only by the release of initiative this insistence upon individual responsibility that we accrue the great sums of individual accomplishment which carry this nation forward this is not an individualism which permits men to run riot in selfishness or to override equality of opportunity for others it permits no violation of ordered liberty in the race after false gods of materialism men and groups have forgotten their country equality of opportunity contains no conception of exploitation by any selfish ruthless class minded men or groups they have no place in the american system as against these stand the guiding ideals and the concepts of our nation i propose to maintain them the solution of our many problems which arise from the shifting scene of national life is not to be found in haphazard experimentation or by revolution it must be through organic development of our national life under these ideals it must secure that cooperative action which brings initiative and strength outside of the government it does not follow because our difficulties are stupendous because there are some souls timorous enough to doubt the validity and effectiveness of our ideals and our system that we must turn to a statecontrolled or statedirected social or economic system in order to cure our troubles that is not liberalism that is tyranny it is the regimentation of men under autocratic bureaucracy with all its extinction of liberty of hope and of opportunity of course no man of understanding says that our system works perfectly it does not for the human race is not yet perfect nevertheless the movement of true civilization is towards freedom rather than regimentation and that is our ideal ofttimes the tendency of democracy in the presence of national danger is to strike blindly to listen to demagogues and to slogans all of which destroy and do not save we have refused to be stampeded into such courses ofttimes democracy elsewhere in the world has been unable to move fast enough to save itself in emergency there have been disheartening delays and failures in legislation and private action which have added to the losses of our people yet this democracy of ours has proved its ability to act our emergency measures of the last years form a definite strategy dominated in the background by these american principles and ideals forming a continuous campaign waged against the forces of destruction on an everwidening and a constantly shifting front thus we have held that the federal government should in the presence of great national danger use its powers to give leadership to the initiative the courage and the fortitude of the people themselves but that it must insist upon individual community and state responsibility that it should furnish leadership to assure the coordination and unity of great existing agencies governmental and private for economic and humanitarian action that where it becomes necessary to meet emergencies beyond the power of these agencies by the creation of new governmental instrumentalities that they should be of such character as not to supplant or weaken but rather to supplement and strengthen the initiative and enterprise of our people that they must directly or indirectly serve all of the people and above all that they should be set up in such form that once the emergency is past they can and must be demobilized and withdrawn leaving our governmental economic and social structure strong and whole we have not feared boldly to adopt unprecedented measures to meet unprecedented violences of the storm but because we have kept ever before us these eternal principles of our nation the american government in its ideals is the same as it was when the people gave the presidency to my trust we shall keep it so we have resolutely rejected the temptation under pressure of immediate events to resort to those panaceas and short cuts which even if temporarily successful would ultimately undermine and weaken what has slowly been built and molded by experience and effort throughout these years it was in accordance with these principles that at the first stage of the depression i called upon the leaders of business and of labor and of agriculture to meet with me and induced them by their own initiative to organize against the panic with all its devastating destruction to uphold wages until the cost of living was adjusted to spread existing employment through shortened hours and to advance construction work against future need it was in pursuance of that same policy that i have each winter thereafter assumed the leadership in mobilizing all of the voluntary and official organizations throughout the country to prevent suffering from hunger and cold and to protect millions of families stricken by drought and when it became advisable to strengthen the states who could no longer carry the full burden of relief to distress it was in accordance with these principles that we held that the federal government should do so through loans to the states and thus maintain the fundamental responsibility of the states themselves we stopped the attempt to turn this effort to the politics of selfish sectional demands and we kept it based upon human need it was in accordance with these principles that in aid to unemployment we expend some millions in federal construction of such public works as can be justified as bringing early and definite returns we have opposed the distortion of these needed works into porkbarrel nonproductive works which impoverish the nation it is in accord with these principles and these purposes that we have made provision for 1millions of loans to self supporting works so that we may increase employment in productive labor we rejected projects of wasteful nonproductive work allocated for purposes of attracting votes instead of affording relief thereby instead of wasteful drain upon the taxpayer we secured the return of their cost to government agencies and at the same time we increased the wealth of the nation it was in accordance with these principles that we have strengthened the capital of the federal land banks that on the one hand confidence in their securities should not be impaired and that on the other the farmers indebted to them should not be unduly deprived of their homes it was in accordance with these purposes that the farm board by emergency loan to farmers cooperatives served to stem panics in agricultural prices and saved hundreds of thousands of farmers and their creditors from bankruptcy it was in accord with these ideas that we have created agencies to prevent bankruptcy and failure in their cooperative organizations that we are erecting new instrumentalities to give credit facilities for their livestock growers and their orderly marketing of their farm products it is in accordance with these principles that in the face of the looming european crises we sought to change the trend of european economic degeneration by our proposals of the german moratorium and the standstill agreements on german private debts we stemmed the tide of collapse in germany and the consequent ruin of its people in furtherance of world stability we have made proposals to reduce the cost of world armaments by billion a year it was in accordance with these principles that i first secured the creation by private initiative of the national credit association whose efforts prevented the failure of hundreds of banks and the loss to countless thousands of depositors who had loaned all of their savings to them it was in accord with these ideas that as the storm grew in intensity we created the reconstruction finance corporation with a capital of billions more to uphold the credit structure of the nation and by thus raising the shield of government credit we prevented the wholesale failure of banks of insurance companies of building and loan associations of farm mortgage associations and of railroads in all of which the public interest is paramount this disaster has been averted through the saving of more than 5institutions and the knowledge that adequate assistance was available to tide others over the stress this has been done not to save a few stockholders but to save millions of american families every one of whose very savings and employment might have been wiped out and whose whole future would have been blighted had these institutions gone down it was in accordance with these principles that we expanded the functions and the powers of the federal reserve banks that they might counteract the stupendous shrinkage of credit due to fear and to hoarding and the foreign withdrawal of our resources it was in accordance with these principles that we are now in process of establishing a new system of home loan banks so that through added strength and through cooperation between the building and loan associations the savings banks and other institutes we may relax the pressures on forfeiture of homes and procure the release of new resources for the construction of more homes and the employment of more men it was in accordance with these principles that we have insisted upon a reduction of governmental expenses for no country can squander itself to prosperity on the ruins of its taxpayers and it was in accordance with these purposes that we have sought new revenues to equalize the diminishing income of the government in order that the power of the federal government to meet the emergency should be impregnable it was in accordance with these principles that we have joined in the development of a world economic conference to bulwark the whole international fabric of finance of monetary values and the expansion of world commerce it was in accordance with these principles and these policies that i am today organizing the private industrial and financial resources of the country to cooperate effectively with the vast governmental instrumentalities which we have in motion so that through their united and coordinated efforts we may move from defense to a powerful attack upon the depression along the whole national front these programs unparalleled in the history of depressions of any country and in any time to care for distress to provide employment to aid agriculture to maintain the financial stability of the country to safeguard the savings of the people to protect their homes are not in the past tense they are in action i shall propose such other measures public and private as may be necessary from time to time to meet the changing situations that may occur and to further speed our economic recovery that recovery may be slow but we shall succeed and come what may i shall maintain through all these measures the sanctity of the great principles under which the republic over a period of years has grown to be the greatest nation of the earth i should like to digress a second for an observation on the last years which should exhilarate the faith of every american and that is the profound growth of the sense of social responsibility in our nation which this depression has demonstrated no government in washington has hitherto considered that it held so broad a responsibility for leadership in such times despite hardships the devotion of our men and women to those in distress is demonstrated by the national averages of infant mortality general mortality and sickness which are less today than in times even of prosperity for the first time in the history of depressions dividends and profits and the cost of living have been reduced before wages have been sacrificed we have been more free from industrial conflict through strikes and lockouts and all forms of social disorder than even in normal times the nation is building the initiative of men and of women toward new fields of social cooperation and new fields of endeavor so much for the great national emergency and the principles of government for which we stand and their application to the measures we have taken there are national policies wider than the emergency wider than the economic horizon they are set forth in our platform having had the responsibility of this office my views upon most of them are clearly and often set forth in public record i may however summarize some of them first i am squarely for a protective tariff i am against the proposal of \\u00e2a competitive tariff for revenue\\u00e2 as advocated by our opponents that would place our farmers and our workers in competition with peasant and sweated labor products from abroad second i am against their proposals to destroy the usefulness of the bipartisan tariff commission the establishment of whose effective powers we secured during this administration just years after it was first advocated by president theodore roosevelt that instrumentality enables us to correct any injustice and to readjust the rates of duty to shifting economic change without constant tinkering and orgies of logrolling by congress if our opponents will descend from the vague generalization to any particular schedule if it be higher than necessary to protect our people or insufficient for their protection it can be remedied by this bipartisan commission without a national election third my views in opposition to the cancellation of the war debt are a matter of detailed record in many public statements and in a recent message to the congress they mark a continuity of that policy maintained by my predecessors i am hopeful of such drastic reduction of world armament as will save the taxpayers in debtor countries a large part of the cost of their payments to us if for any particular annual payment we were offered some other tangible form of compensation such as the expansion of markets for american agriculture and labor and the restoration and maintenance of our prosperity then i am sure our citizens would consider such a proposal but it is a certainty that these debts must not be canceled or these burdens transferred to the backs of the american people fourth i insist upon an army and navy of a strength which guarantees that no foreign soldier will land upon the american soil that strength is relative to other nations i favor every arms reduction which preserves that relationship i favor rigidly restricted immigration i have by executive direction in order to relieve us of added unemployment already reduced the inward movement to less than the outward movement i shall adhere to that policy sixth i have repeatedly recommended to the congress a revision of railway transportation laws in order that we may create greater stability and greater assurance of that vital service in our transportation i shall persist in it i have repeatedly recommended the federal regulation of interstate power i shall persist in that i have opposed the federal government undertaking the operation of the power business i shall continue in that opposition i have for years supported the conservation of national resources i have made frequent recommendations to the congress in respect thereto including legislation to correct the waste and destruction of these resources through the present interpretations of the antitrust laws i shall continue to urge such action this depression has exposed many weaknesses in our economic system there has been exploitation and abuse of financial power we will fearlessly and unremittingly reform these abuses i have recommended to the congress the reform of our banking laws unfortunately this legislation has not yet been enacted the american people must have protection from insecure banking through a stronger banking system they must be relieved from conditions which permit the credit machinery of the country to be made available without check for wholesale speculation in securities with ruinous consequence to millions of our citizens and to our national economy i have recommended to congress methods of emergency relief to the depositors of closed banks for years i have repeatedly warned against private loans abroad for nonproductive purposes i shall persist in all those matters i have insisted upon a balanced budget as the foundation of all public and private financial stability and of all public confidence i shall insist on the maintenance of that policy recent increases in revenues while temporary should be again examined and if they tend to sap the vitality of industry and thus retard employment they should be revised the first necessity of the nation the wealth and income of whose citizens has been reduced is to reduce the expenditures on governmentnational state and local it is in the relief of taxes from the backs of men through which we liberate their powers it is through lower expenditures that we get lower taxes this must be done a considerable reduction in federal expenditures has been attained if we except those extraordinary expenditures imposed upon us by the depression it will be found that the federal government is operating some million less annually today than years ago the congress rejected recommendations from the administration which would have saved an additional million this fiscal year the opposition leadership insisted as the price of vital reconstruction legislation and over the protest of our leaders upon adding million of costs to the taxpayer through public works inadvisable at this time i shall repeat these proposals for economy the opposition leadership in the house of representatives in the last months secured the passage by that house of billion in raids upon the public treasury they have been stopped and i shall continue to oppose such raids i have repeatedly for years urged the congress either themselves to abolish obsolete bureaus and commissions and to reorganize the whole government structure in the interest of economy or to give someone the authority to do it i have succeeded partially in securing that authority but i regret that no great act under it can be effective until after the approval of the next congress with the collapse of world prices and the depreciated currencies the farmer was never so dependent upon his tariff protection for recovery as he is at the present time we shall hold to that as a national policy we have enacted many measures of emergency relief to agriculture they are having their effect i shall keep them functioning until the strain is past the original purpose of the farm board was to strengthen the efforts of the farmer to establish his own farmerowned farmer controlled marketing agencies it has greatly succeeded in this purpose even in these times of adversity the departure of the farm board from its original purpose by making loans to farmers cooperatives to preserve prices from panic served an emergency but such an action in normal times is absolutely destructive of the farmers own interest we still have vast problems to solve in agriculture but no power on earth can restore prices except by restoration of the general recovery and by restoration of markets every measure that we have taken looking to general recovery is of benefit to the farmer there is no relief to the farmer by extending governmental bureaucracy to control his production and thus to curtail his liberties nor by subsidies that bring only more bureaucracy and their ultimate collapse and i shall continue to oppose them the most practicable relief to the farmer today aside from general economic recovery is a definite program of readjustment and coordination of national state and local taxation which will relieve real property especially the farms from the unfair burdens of taxation which the current readjustment in values have brought about to that purpose i propose to devote myself i have always favored the development of rivers and harbors and highways these improvements have been greatly expedited in the last years we shall continue that work to completion after years of discussion between the united states and our great neighbor to the north i have signed a treaty for the construction of the great lakes st lawrence seaway that treaty does not injure the chicago to the gulf waterway the work upon which together with the whole mississippi system i have expedited and in which i am equally interested we shall undertake this great seaway the greatest public improvement ever undertaken upon our continent with its consequent employment of men as quickly as that treaty can be ratified our views upon sound currency require no elucidation they are indelibly a part of republican history and policies we have affirmed them by preventing the democratic majority in the house from effecting wild schemes of uncontrolled inflation in the last months there are many other important subjects set forth in the platform and in my public statements in the past for which i will not take your time there are one or two others that do merit some emphasis the leadership of the federal government is not to be confined to economic and international questions there are problems of the home and the education of children and of citizenship they are the most vital of all to the future of the nation except in the case of aids to states which i have recommended for stimulation of the protection and health of children they are not matters of legislation we have given leadership to the initiative of our people for social advancement through this organization against illiteracy through the white house conferences on the protection and health of children through the national conferences on homeownership through the stimulation of social and recreational agencies these are the visible evidences of spiritual leadership in the government they will be continued and they will be constantly invigorated my foreign policies have been devoted to strengthening the foundations of world peace we inaugurated the london naval treaty which reduced arms and limited the ratios between the fleets of the three powers we have made concrete proposals at geneva to reduce the armaments of the world by onethird it would save the taxpayers of the world a billion a year we could save ourselves millions a year it would reduce fear and danger of war we have expanded the arbitration of disputes i have recommended joining the world court under proper reservations preserving our freedom of action above all we have given leadership in the transforming of the kelloggbriand pact from an inspiring outlawry of war to an organized instrument for peaceful settlements backed by definite mobilized world public opinion against aggression we shall under the spirit of that pact consult with other nations in time of emergency to promote world peace we shall enter into no agreements committing us to any future course of action or which call for use of force in order to preserve peace i have projected a new doctrine into international affairs the doctrine that we do not and never will recognize title to the possession of territory gained in violation of the peace pacts which were signed with us that doctrine has been accepted by all the nations of the world on a recent critical occasion and within the last few days has been again accepted by all the nations of the western hemisphere that is public opinion made tangible and effective the world needs peace it must have peace with justice i shall continue to strive unceasingly with every power of mind and spirit to explore every possible path that leads towards a world in which right triumphs over force in which reason rules over passion in which men and women may rear their children not to be devoured by war but to pursue in safety the nobler arts of peace i shall continue to build upon these designs across the path of the nations consideration of these vast problems of economic and social order there has arisen a bitter controversy over the control of the liquor traffic i have always sympathized with the high purpose of the 18th amendment and i have used every power at my command to make it effective over this entire country i have hoped that it was the final solution of the evils of the liquor traffic against which our people have striven for generations it has succeeded in great measure in those many communities where the majority sentiment is favorable to it but in other and increasing numbers of communities there is a majority sentiment unfavorable to it laws which are opposed by the majority sentiment create resentments which undermine enforcement and in the end produce degeneration and crime our opponents pledge the members of their party to destroy every vestige of constitutional and effective federal control of the traffic that means that over large areas the return of the saloon system with its corruption its moral and social abuse which debauched the home its deliberate interference with the states endeavoring to find honest solution its permeation of political parties its perversion of legislatures which reached even to the capital of the nation the 18th amendment smashed that regime as by a stroke of lightning i can not consent to the return of that system again we must recognize the difficulties which have developed in making the 18th amendment effective and that grave abuses have grown up in order to secure the enforcement of the amendment under our dual form of government the constitutional provision called for concurrent action on one hand by the state and local authorities and on the other by the federal government its enforcement requires therefore independent but coincident action of both agencies an increasing number of states and municipalities are proving themselves unwilling to engage in that enforcement due to these forces there is in large sections increasing illegal traffic in liquor but worse than this there has been in those areas a spread of disrespect not only for this law but for all laws grave dangers of practical nullification of the constitution an increase in subsidized crime and violence i can not consent to a continuation of that regime i refuse to accept either of these destinies on the one hand to return to the old saloon with its political and social corruption or on the other to endure the bootlegger and the speakeasy with their abuses and crime either of them are intolerable and they are not the only ways out now our objective must be a sane solution not a blind leap back to old evils moreover a step backwards would result in a chaos of new evils not yet experienced because the local systems of prohibition and controls which were developed over generations have been in a large degree abandoned under this amendment the republican platform recommends submission of the question to the states and that the people themselves may determine whether they desire a change but insists that this submission shall propose a constructive and not a destructive change it does not dictate to the conscience of any member of the party the first duty of the president of the united states is to enforce the laws as they exist that i shall continue to do to the best of my ability any other course would be the abrogation of the very guarantees of liberty itself now the constitution gives the president no power or authority with respect to changes in the constitution itself nevertheless my countrymen have a right to know my conclusions upon this question they are based upon the broad facts that i have stated upon my experience in this high office and upon my deep conviction that our purpose must be the elimination of the evils of this traffic from this civilization by practical measures it is my belief that in order to remedy present evils a change is necessary by which we resummon a proper share of initiative and responsibility which the very essence of our government demands shall rest upon the states and the local authorities that change must avoid the return of the saloon it is my conviction that the nature of this change and one upon which all reasonable people can find common ground is that each state shall be given the right to deal with the problem as it may determine but subject to the absolute guarantees in the constitution of the united states to protect each state from interference and invasion by its neighbors and that in no part of the united states shall there be a return of the saloon system with its inevitable political and social corruption and its organized interference with other states and other communities american statesmanship is capable of working out such a solution and making it effective my fellow citizens the discussion of great problems of economic life and of government seem abstract and cold but within their right solution lies the happiness and the hope of a great people without such solution all else is mere verbal sympathy today millions of our fellow countrymen are out of work prices of farmers products are below a living standard many millions more who are in business or hold employment are haunted by fears for the future no man with a spark of humanity can sit in my place without suffering from the picture of their anxieties and hardships before him day and night they would be more than human if they were not led to blame their condition upon the government in power i have understood their sufferings and have worked to the limits of my strength to produce action that would be of help to them much remains to be done to attain recovery we have had a great and unparalleled shock the emergency measures now in action represent an unparalleled use of national power to relieve distress to provide employment to serve agriculture to preserve the stability of the government and to maintain the integrity of our institutions our policies prevent unemployment caused by floods of imported goods and of laborers our policies preserve peace in the world they embrace cooperation with other nations in those fields in which we can serve with patience and perseverance these measures will succeed despite the dislocation of economic life our great tools of production and distribution are more efficient than ever before our fabulous national resources our farms and homes and our skill are unimpaired from the hard won experience of this depression we shall build stronger methods of prevention and stronger methods of protection to our people from abuses that have become evident we shall march to a far greater accomplishment with the united effort we can and will turn the tide towards the restoration of business of employment and of agriculture it does call for the utmost devotion and the utmost wisdom every reserve of american courage and vision must be called upon to sustain us and to plan wisely for the future through it all our first duty is to preserve unfettered that dominant american spirit which has produced our enterprise and our individual character that is the bedrock of the past and it is the sole guarantee of the future not regimented mechanisms but free men are our goal herein is the fundamental issue a representative democracy progressive and unafraid to meet its problems but meeting them upon the foundations of experience and not upon the wave of emotion or the insensate demands of a radicalism which grasps at every opportunity to exploit the sufferings of a people with these courses we shall emerge from this great national strain with our american system of life and government strengthened our people will be free to reassert their energy and their enterprise in a society eager to reward in full measure those whose industry serves its well being our youth will find the doors of equal opportunity still open the problems of the next few years are not only economic they are also moral and spiritual the present check to our material success must deeply stir our national conscience upon the purposes of life itself it must cause us to revalue and reshape our drift from materialism to a higher note of individual and national ideals underlying every purpose is the spiritual application of moral ideals which are the fundamental basis of the happiness of a people this is a land of homes and of churches and schoolhouses dedicated to the sober and enduring satisfactions of family life and the rearing of children in an atmosphere of ideals and of religious faith only with those ideals and those high standards can we hold society together and only from them can government survive and business prosper they are the sole insurance to the safety of our children and to the continuity of the nation if it shall appear that while i have had the honor of the presidency that i have contributed to the part required from this high office to bringing the republic through this dark night and if in my administration we shall see the break of dawn of the better day i shall have done my part in the world no man can have a greater honor than that i have but one desire that is to see my country again on the road to prosperity which shall be more sane and lasting through the lessons of this experience to see the principles and ideals of the american people perpetuated i rest the case of the republican party upon the intelligence and the just discernment of the american people should my countrymen again place upon me the responsibilities of this high office i shall carry forward the work of reconstruction i shall hope long before another years have passed to see the world prosperous and at peace and every american home again in the sunshine of genuine progress and of genuine prosperity i shall seek to maintain untarnished and unweakened those fundamental traditions and principles upon which our nation was rounded upon which it has grown i shall invite and welcome the help of every man and woman in the preservation of the united states for the happiness of its people this is my pledge to the nation and my pledge to the almighty god\",\n          \"to the senate and house of representatives notwithstanding the added burdens rendered necessary by the war our people rejoice in a very satisfactory and steadily increasing degree of prosperity evidenced by the largest volume of business ever recorded manufacture has been productive agricultural pursuits have yielded abundant returns labor in all fields of industry is better rewarded revenue legislation passed by the present congress has increased the treasurys receipts to the amount estimated by its authors the finances of the government have been successfully administered and its credit advanced to the first rank while its currency has been maintained at the worlds highest standard military service under a common flag and for a righteous cause has strengthened the national spirit and served to cement more closely than ever the fraternal bonds between every section of the country a review of the relation of the united states to other powers always appropriate is this year of primary importance in view of the momentous issues which have arisen demanding in one instance the ultimate determination by arms and involving farreaching consequences which will require the earnest attention of the congress in my last annual message very full consideration was given to the question of the duty of the government of the united states toward spain and the cuban insurrection as being by far the most important problem with which we were then called upon to deal the considerations then advanced and the exposition of the views therein expressed disclosed my sense of the extreme gravity of the situation setting aside as logically unfounded or practically inadmissible the recognition of the cuban insurgents as belligerents the recognition of the independence of cuba neutral intervention to end the war by imposing a rational compromise between the contestants intervention in favor of one or the other party and forcible annexation of the island i concluded it was honestly due to our friendly relations with spain that she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations of reform to which she had become irrevocably committed within a few weeks previously she had announced comprehensive plans which it was confidently asserted would be efficacious to remedy the evils so deeply affecting our own country so injurious to the true interests of the mother country as well as to those of cuba and so repugnant to the universal sentiment of humanity the ensuing month brought little sign of real progress toward the pacification of cuba the autonomous administrations set up in the capital and some of the principal cities appeared not to gain the favor of the inhabitants nor to be able to extend their influence to the large extent of territory held by the insurgents while the military arm obviously unable to cope with the still active rebellion continued many of the most objectionable and offensive policies of the government that had preceded it no tangible relief was afforded the vast numbers of unhappy reconcentrados despite the reiterated professions made in that regard and the amount appropriated by spain to that end the proffered expedient of zones of cultivation proved illusory indeed no less practical nor more delusive promises of succor could well have been tendered to the exhausted and destitute people stripped of all that made life and home dear and herded in a strange region among unsympathetic strangers hardly less necessitous than themselves by the end of december the mortality among them had frightfully increased conservative estimates from spanish sources placed the deaths among these distressed people at over per cent from the time general weylers decree of reconcentration was enforced with the acquiescence of the spanish authorities a scheme was adopted for relief by charitable contributions raised in this country and distributed under the direction of the support and the several consuls by noble and earnest individual effort through the organized agencies of the american red cross thousands of lives were thus saved but many thousands more were inaccessible to such forms of aid the war continued on the old footing without comprehensive plan developing only the same spasmodic encounters barren of strategic result that had marked the course of the earlier ten years rebellion as well as the present insurrection from its start no alternative save physical exhaustion of either combatant and therewithal the practical ruin of the island lay in sight but how far distant no one could venture to conjecture at this juncture on the 15th of february last occurred the destruction of the battle ship maine while rightfully lying in the harbor of havana on a mission of international courtesy and good will a catastrophe the suspicious nature and horror of which stirred the nations heart profoundly it is a striking evidence of the poise and sturdy good sense distinguishing our national character that this shocking blow falling upon a generous people already deeply touched by preceding events in cuba did not move them to an instant desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the existence of a condition of danger and disorder at our doors that made possible such a deed by whomsoever wrought yet the instinct of justice prevailed and the nation anxiously awaited the result of the searching investigation at once set on foot the finding of the naval board of inquiry established that the origin of the explosion was external by a submarine mine and only halted through lack of positive testimony to fix the responsibility of its authorship all these things carried conviction to the most thoughtful even before the finding of the naval court that a crisis in our relations with spain and toward cuba was at hand so strong was this belief that it needed but a brief executive suggestion to the congress to receive immediate answer to the duty of making instant provision for the possible and perhaps speedily probable emergency of war and the remarkable almost unique spectacle was presented of a unanimous vote of both houses on the 9th of march appropriating 50000\\u00e2for the national defense and for each and every purpose connected therewith to be expended at the discretion of the president\\u00e2 that this act of prevision came none too soon was disclosed when the application of the fund was undertaken our coasts were practically undefended our navy needed large provision for increased ammunition and supplies and even numbers to cope with any sudden attack from the navy of spain which comprised modern vessels of the highest type of continental perfection our army also required enlargement of men and munitions the details of the hurried preparation for the dreaded contingency are told in the reports of the secretaries of war and of the navy and need not be repeated here it is sufficient to say that the outbreak of war when it did come found our nation not unprepared to meet the conflict nor was the apprehension of coming strife confined to our own country it was felt by the continental powers which on april 6 through their ambassadors and envoys addressed to the executive an expression of hope that humanity and moderation might mark the course of this government and people and that further negotiations would lead to an agreement which while securing the maintenance of peace would afford all necessary guaranties for the reestablishment of order in cuba in responding to that representation i said i shared the hope the envoys had expressed that peace might be preserved in a manner to terminate the chronic condition of disturbance in cuba so injurious and menacing to our interests and tranquillity as well as shocking to our sentiments of humanity and while appreciating the humanitarian and disinterested character of the communication they had made on behalf of the powers i stated the confidence of this government for its part that equal appreciation would be shown for its own earnest and unselfish endeavors to fulfill a duty to humanity by ending a situation the indefinite prolongation of which had become insufferable still animated by the hope of a peaceful solution and obeying the dictates of duty no effort was relaxed to bring about a speedy ending of the cuban struggle negotiations to this object continued actively with the government of spain looking to the immediate conclusion of a six months armistice in cuba with a view to effect the recognition of her peoples right to independence besides this the instant revocation of the order of reconcentration was asked so that the sufferers returning to their homes and aided by united american and spanish effort might be put in a way to support themselves and by orderly resumption of the well nigh destroyed productive energies of the island contribute to the restoration of its tranquillity and well being negotiations continued for some little time at madrid resulting in offers by the spanish government which could not but be regarded as inadequate it was proposed to confide the preparation of peace to the insular parliament yet to be convened under the autonomous decrees of november 1897 but without impairment in any wise of the constitutional powers of the madrid government which to that end would grant an armistice if solicited by the insurgents for such time as the general in chief might see fit to fix how and with what scope of discretionary powers the insular parliament was expected to set about the \\u00e2preparation\\u00e2 of peace did not appear if it were to be by negotiation with the insurgents the issue seemed to rest on the one side with a body chosen by a fraction of the electors in the districts under spanish control and on the other with the insurgent population holding the interior country unrepresented in the socalled parliament and defiant at the suggestion of suing for peace grieved and disappointed at this barren outcome of my sincere endeavors to reach a practicable solution i felt it my duty to remit the whole question to the congress in the message of april 11 1898 i announced that with this last overture in the direction of immediate peace in cuba and its disappointing reception by spain the effort of the executive was brought to an end i again reviewed the alternative courses of action which had been proposed concluding that the only one consonant with international policy and compatible with our firm set historical traditions was intervention as a neutral to stop the war and check the hopeless sacrifice of life even though that resort involved \\u00e2hostile constraint upon both the parties to the contest as well to enforce a truce as to guide the eventual settlement\\u00e2 the grounds justifying that step were the interests of humanity the duty to protect the life and property of our citizens in cuba the right to check injury to our commerce and people through the devastation of the island and most important the need of removing at once and forever the constant menace and the burdens entailed upon our government by the uncertainties and perils of the situation caused by the unendurable disturbance in cuba i said the long trial has proved that the object for which spain has waged the war can not be attained the fire of insurrection may flame or may smolder with varying seasons but it has not been and it is plain that it can not be extinguished by present methods the only hope of relief and repose from a condition which can no longer be endured is the enforced pacification of cuba in the name of humanity in the name of civilization in behalf of endangered american interests which give us the right and the duty to speak and to act the war in cuba must stop in view of all this the congress was asked to authorize and empower the president to take measures to secure a full and final termination of hostilities between spain and the people of cuba and to secure in the island the establishment of a stable government capable of maintaining order and observing its international obligations insuring peace and tranquillity and the security of its citizens as well as our own and for the accomplishment of those ends to use the military and naval forces of the united states as might be necessary with added authority to continue generous relief to the starving people of cuba the response of the congress after nine days of earnest deliberation during which the almost unanimous sentiment of your body was developed on every point save as to the expediency of coupling the proposed action with a formal recognition of the republic of cuba as the true and lawful government of that island a proposition which failed of adoption the congress after conference on the 19th of april by a vote of to in the senate and to in the house of representatives passed the memorable joint resolution declaring first that the people of the island of cuba are and of right ought to be free and independent second that it is the duty of the united states to demand and the government of the united states does hereby demand that the government of spain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island of cuba and withdraw its land and naval forces from cuba and cuban waters third that the president of the united states be and he hereby is directed and empowered to use the entire land and naval forces of the united states and to call into the actual service of the united states the militia of the several states to such extent as may be necessary to carry these resolutions into effect fourth that the united states hereby disclaims any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty jurisdiction or control over said island except for the pacification thereof and asserts its determination when that is accomplished to leave the government and control of the island to its people this resolution was approved by the executive on the next day april 20 a copy was at once communicated to the spanish minister at this capital who forthwith announced that his continuance in washington had thereby become impossible and asked for his passports which were given him he thereupon withdrew from washington leaving the protection of spanish interests in the united states to the french ambassador and the austrohungarian minister simultaneously with its communication to the spanish minister here general woodford the american minister at madrid was telegraphed confirmation of the text of the joint resolution and directed to communicate it to the government of spain with the formal demand that it at once relinquish its authority and government in the island of cuba and withdraw its forces therefrom coupling this demand with announcement of the intentions of this government as to the future of the island in conformity with the fourth clause of the resolution and giving spain until noon of april to reply that demand although as above shown officially made known to the spanish envoy here was not delivered at madrid after the instruction reached general woodford on the morning of april 21 but before he could present it the spanish minister of state notified him that upon the presidents approval of the joint resolution the madrid government regarding the act as \\u00e2equivalent to an evident declaration of war\\u00e2 had ordered its minister in washington to withdraw thereby breaking off diplomatic relations between the two countries and ceasing all official communication between their respective representatives general woodford thereupon demanded his passports and quitted madrid the same day spain having thus denied the demand of the united states and initiated that complete form of rupture of relations which attends a state of war the executive powers authorized by the resolution were at once used by me to meet the enlarged contingency of actual war between sovereign states on april i proclaimed a blockade of the north coast of cuba including ports on said coast between cardenas and bahia honda and the port of cienfuegos on the south coast of cuba and on the 23d i called for volunteers to execute the purpose of the resolution by my message of april the congress was informed of the situation and i recommended formal declaration of the existence of a state of war between the united states and spain the congress accordingly voted on the same day the act approved april 25 1898 declaring the existence of such war from and including the 21st day of april and reenacted the provision of the resolution of april directing the president to use all the armed forces of the nation to carry that act into effect due notification of the existence of war as aforesaid was given april by telegraph to all the governments with which the united states maintain relations in order that their neutrality might be assured during the war the various governments responded with proclamations of neutrality each after its own methods it is not among the least gratifying incidents of the struggle that the obligations of neutrality were impartially discharged by all often under delicate and difficult circumstances in further fulfillment of international duty i issued april 26 1893 a proclamation announcing the treatment proposed to be accorded to vessels and their cargoes as to blockade contraband the exercise of the right of search and the immunity of neutral flags and neutral goods under enemys flag a similar proclamation was made by the spanish government in the conduct of hostilities the rules of the declaration of paris including abstention from resort to privateering have accordingly been observed by both belligerents although neither was a party to that declaration our country thus after an interval of half a century of peace with all nations found itself engaged in deadly conflict with a foreign enemy every nerve was strained to meet the emergency the response to the initial call for 125volunteers was instant and complete as was also the result of the second call of may 25 for 75additional volunteers the ranks of the regular army were increased to the limits provided by the act of april 26 1898 the enlisted force of the navy on the 15th day of august when it reached its maximum numbered 24men and apprentices one hundred and three vessels were added to the navy by purchase was presented to the government leased and the vessels of the international navigation company the st paul st louis new york and paris were chartered in addition to these the revenue cutters and lighthouse tenders were turned over to the navy department and became temporarily a part of the auxiliary navy the maximum effective fighting force of the navy during the war separated into classes was as follows four battle ships of the first class battle ship of the second class armored cruisers secondhand monitors armored ram protected cruisers unprotected cruisers gunboats dynamite cruiser torpedo boats vessels of the old navy including monitors 14 auxiliary navy auxiliary cruisers converted yachts converted tugs converted colliers revenue cutters lighthouse tenders and miscellaneous vessels much alarm was felt along our entire atlantic seaboard lest some attack might be made by the enemy every precaution was taken to prevent possible injury to our great cities lying along the coast temporary garrisons were provided drawn from the state militia infantry and light batteries were drawn from the volunteer force about 12troops were thus employed the coast signal service was established for observing the approach of an enemys ships to the coast of the united states and the lifesaving and lighthouse services cooperated which enabled the navy department to have all portions of the atlantic coast from maine to texas under observation the auxiliary navy was created under the authority of congress and was officered and manned by the naval militia of the several states this organization patrolled the coast and performed the duty of a second line of defense under the direction of the chief of engineers submarine mines were placed at the most exposed points before the outbreak of the war permanent mining casemates and cable galleries had been constructed at nearly all important harbors most of the torpedo material was not to be found in the market and had to be specially manufactured under date of april district officers were directed to take all preliminary measures short of the actual attaching of the loaded mines to the cables and on april telegraphic orders were issued to place the loaded mines in position the aggregate number of mines placed was 1535 at the principal harbors from maine to california preparations were also made for the planting of mines at certain other harbors but owing to the early destruction of the spanish fleet these mines were not placed the signal corps was promptly organized and performed service of the most difficult and important character its operations during the war covered the electrical connection of all coast fortifications the establishment of telephonic and telegraphic facilities for the camps at manila santiago and in puerto rico there were constructed miles of line at ten great camps thus facilitating military movements from those points in a manner heretofore unknown in military administration field telegraph lines were established and maintained under the enemys fire at manila and later the manilahongkong cable was reopened in puerto rico cable communications were opened over a discontinued route and on land the headquarters of the commanding officer was kept in telegraphic or telephonic communication with the division commanders on four different lines of operations there was placed in cuban waters a completely outfitted cable ship with war cables and cable gear suitable both for the destruction of communications belonging to the enemy and the establishment of our own two ocean cables were destroyed under the enemys batteries at santiago the day previous to the landing of general shafters corps at caimanera within miles of the landing place cable communications were established and a cable station opened giving direct communication with the government at washington this service was invaluable to the executive in directing the operations of the army and navy with a total force of over 1300 the loss was by disease in camp and field officers and men included only 5 the nationaldefense fund of 50000was expended in large part by the army and navy and the objects for which it was used are fully shown in the reports of the several secretaries it was a most timely appropriation enabling the government to strengthen its defenses and make preparations greatly needed in case of war this fund being inadequate to the requirements of equipment and for the conduct of the war the patriotism of the congress provided the means in the warrevenue act of june by authorizing a per cent popular loan not to exceed 400000and by levying additional imposts and taxes of the authorized loan 200000were offered and promptly taken the subscriptions so far exceeding the call as to cover it many times over while preference being given to the smaller bids no single allotment exceeded 5000 this was a most encouraging and significant result showing the vast resources of the nation and the determination of the people to uphold their countrys honor it is not within the province of this message to narrate the history of the extraordinary war that followed the spanish declaration of april 21 but a brief recital of its more salient features is appropriate the first encounter of the war in point of date took place april 27 when a detachment of the blockading squadron made a reconnoissance in force at matanzas shelled the harbor forts and demolished several new works in construction the next engagement was destined to mark a memorable epoch in maritime warfare the pacific fleet under commodore george dewey had lain for some weeks at hongkong upon the colonial proclamation of neutrality being issued and the customary twentyfour hours notice being given it repaired to mirs bay near hongkong whence it proceeded to the philippine islands under telegraphed orders to capture or destroy the formidable spanish fleet then assembled at manila at daybreak on the 1st of may the american force entered manila bay and after a few hours engagement effected the total destruction of the spanish fleet consisting of ten war ships and a transport besides capturing the naval station and forts at cavite thus annihilating the spanish naval power in the pacific ocean and completely controlling the bay of manila with the ability to take the city at will not a life was lost on our ships the wounded only numbering seven while not a vessel was materially injured for this gallant achievement the congress upon my recommendation fitly bestowed upon the actors preferment and substantial reward the effect of this remarkable victory upon the spirit of our people and upon the fortunes of the war was instant a prestige of invincibility thereby attached to our arms which continued throughout the struggle reenforcements were hurried to manila under the command of majorgeneral merritt and firmly established within sight of the capital which lay helpless before our guns on the 7th day of may the government was advised officially of the victory at manila and at once inquired of the commander of our fleet what troops would be required the information was received on the 15th day of may and the first army expedition sailed may and arrived off manila june 30 other expeditions soon followed the total force consisting of officers and 15enlisted men only reluctance to cause needless loss of life and property prevented the early storming and capture of the city and therewith the absolute military occupancy of the whole group the insurgents meanwhile had resumed the active hostilities suspended by the uncompleted truce of december 1897 their forces invested manila from the northern and eastern sides but were constrained by admiral dewey and general merrill from attempting an assault it was fitting that whatever was to be done in the way of decisive operations in that quarter should be accomplished by the strong arm of the united states alone obeying the stern precept of war which enjoins the overcoming of the adversary and the extinction of his power wherever assailable as the speedy and sure means to win a peace divided victory was not permissible for no partition of the rights and responsibilities attending the enforcement of a just and advantageous peace could be thought of following the comprehensive scheme of general attack powerful forces were assembled at various points on our coast to invade cuba and puerto rico meanwhile naval demonstrations were made at several exposed points on may the cruiser wilmington and torpedo boat winslow were unsuccessful in an attempt to silence the batteries at cardenas a gallant ensign worth bagley and four seamen falling these grievous fatalities were strangely enough among the very few which occurred during our naval operations in this extraordinary conflict meanwhile the spanish naval preparations had been pushed with great vigor a powerful squadron under admiral cervera which had assembled at the cape verde islands before the outbreak of hostilities had crossed the ocean and by its erratic movements in the caribbean sea delayed our military plans while baffling the pursuit of our fleets for a time fears were felt lest the oregon and marietta then nearing home after their long voyage from san francisco of over 15miles might be surprised by admiral cerveras fleet but their fortunate arrival dispelled these apprehensions and lent muchneeded reenforcement not until admiral cervera took refuge in the harbor of santiago de cuba about may 19 was it practicable to plan a systematic naval and military attack upon the antillean possessions of spain several demonstrations occurred on the coasts of cuba and puerto rico in preparation for the larger event on may the north atlantic squadron shelled san juan de puerto rico on may commodore schleys squadron bombarded the forts guarding the mouth of santiago harbor neither attack had any material result it was evident that well ordered land operations were indispensable to achieve a decisive advantage the next act in the war thrilled not alone the hearts of our countrymen but the world by its exceptional heroism on the night of june lieutenant hobson aided by seven devoted volunteers blocked the narrow outlet from santiago harbor by sinking the collier merrimac in the channel under a fierce fire from the shore batteries escaping with their lives as by a miracle but falling into the hands of the spaniards it is a most gratifying incident of the war that the bravery of this little band of heroes was cordially appreciated by the spanish admiral who sent a flag of truce to notify admiral sampson of their safety and to compliment them on their daring act they were subsequently exchanged july 7 by june the cutting of the last cuban cable isolated the island thereafter the invasion was vigorously prosecuted on june 10 under a heavy protecting fire a landing of marines from the oregon marblehead and yankee was effected in guantanamo bay where it had been determined to establish a naval station this important and essential port was taken from the enemy after severe fighting by the marines who were the first organized force of the united states to land in cuba the position so won was held despite desperate attempts to dislodge our forces by june additional forces were landed and strongly intrenched on june the advance of the invading army under majorgeneral shafter landed at daiquiri about miles east of santiago this was accomplished under great difficulties but with marvelous dispatch on june the movement against santiago was begun on the 24th the first serious engagement took place in which the first and tenth cavalry and the first united states volunteer cavalry general youngs brigade of general wheelers division participated losing heavily by nightfall however ground within miles of santiago was won the advantage was steadily increased on july a severe battle took place our forces gaining the outworks of santiago on the 2d el caney and san juan were taken after a desperate charge and the investment of the city was completed the navy cooperated by shelling the town and the coast forts on the day following this brilliant achievement of our land forces the 3d of july occurred the decisive naval combat of the war the spanish fleet attempting to leave the harbor was met by the american squadron under command of commodore sampson in less than three hours all the spanish ships were destroyed the two torpedo boats being sunk and the maria teresa almirante oquendo vizcaya and cristobal colon driven ashore the spanish admiral and over 1men were taken prisoners while the enemys loss of life was deplorably large some perishing on our side but one man was killed on the brooklyn and one man seriously wounded although our ships were repeatedly struck not one was seriously injured where all so conspicuously distinguished themselves from the commanders to the gunners and the unnamed heroes in the boiler rooms each and all contributing toward the achievement of this astounding victory for which neither ancient nor modern history affords a parallel in the completeness of the event and the marvelous disproportion of casualties it would be invidious to single out any for especial honor deserved promotion has rewarded the more conspicuous actors the nations profoundest gratitude is due to all of these brave men who by their skill and devotion in a few short hours crushed the sea power of spain and wrought a triumph whose decisiveness and farreaching consequences can scarcely be measured nor can we be unmindful of the achievements of our builders mechanics and artisans for their skill in the construction of our war ships with the catastrophe of santiago spains effort upon the ocean virtually ceased a spasmodic effort toward the end of june to send her mediterranean fleet under admiral camara to relieve manila was abandoned the expedition being recalled after it had passed through the suez canal the capitulation of santiago followed the city was closely besieged by land while the entrance of our ships into the harbor cut off all relief on that side after a truce to allow of the removal of noncombatants protracted negotiations continued from july until july 15 when under menace of immediate assault the preliminaries of surrender were agreed upon on the 17th general shafter occupied the city the capitulation embraced the entire eastern end of cuba the number of spanish soldiers surrendering was 22000 all of whom were subsequently conveyed to spain at the charge of the united states the story of this successful campaign is told in the report of the secretary of war which will be laid before you the individual valor of officers and soldiers was never more strikingly shown than in the several engagements leading to the surrender of santiago while the prompt movements and successive victories won instant and universal applause to those who gained this complete triumph which established the ascendency of the united states upon land as the fight off santiago had fixed our supremacy on the seas the earnest and lasting gratitude of the nation is unsparingly due nor should we alone remember the gallantry of the living the dead claim our tears and our losses by battle and disease must cloud any exultation at the result and teach us to weigh the awful cost of war however rightful the cause or signal the victory with the fall of santiago the occupation of puerto rico became the next strategic necessity general miles had previously been assigned to organize an expedition for that purpose fortunately he was already at santiago where he had arrived on the 11th of july with reenforcements for general shafters army with these troops consisting of 3infantry and artillery two companies of engineers and one company of the signal corps general miles left guantanamo on july 21 having nine transports convoyed by the fleet under captain higginson with the massachusetts flagship dixie gloucester columbia and yale the two latter carrying troops the expedition landed at guanica july 25 which port was entered with little opposition here the fleet was joined by the annapolis and the wasp while the puritan and amphitrite went to san juan and joined the new orleans which was engaged in blockading that port the majorgeneral commanding was subsequently reenforced by general schwans brigade of the third army corps by general wilson with a part of his division and also by general brooke with a part of his corps numbering in all 16officers and men on july he entered ponce one of the most important ports in the island from which he thereafter directed operations for the capture of the island with the exception of encounters with the enemy at guayama hormigueros coamo and yauco and an attack on a force landed at cape san juan there was no serious resistance the campaign was prosecuted with great vigor and by the 12th of august much of the island was in our possession and the acquisition of the remainder was only a matter of a short time at most of the points in the island our troops were enthusiastically welcomed protestations of loyalty to the flag and gratitude for delivery from spanish rule met our commanders at every stage as a potent influence toward peace the outcome of the puerto rican expedition was of great consequence and generous commendation is due to those who participated in it the last scene of the war was enacted at manila its starting place on august 15 after a brief assault upon the works by the land forces in which the squadron assisted the capital surrendered unconditionally the casualties were comparatively few by this the conquest of the philippine islands virtually accomplished when the spanish capacity for resistance was destroyed by admiral deweys victory of the 1st of may was formally sealed to general merrill his officers and men for their uncomplaining and devoted service and for their gallantry in action the nation is sincerely grateful their long voyage was made with singular success and the soldierly conduct of the men most of whom were without previous experience in the military service deserves unmeasured praise the total casualties in killed and wounded in the army during the war with spain were officers killed 23 enlisted men killed 257 total 280 officers wounded 113 enlisted men wounded 1464 total 1577 of the navy killed 17 wounded 67 died as result of wounds 1 invalided from service 6 total 91 it will be observed that while our navy was engaged in two great battles and in numerous perilous undertakings in blockade and bombardment and more than 50of our troops were transported to distant lands and were engaged in assault and siege and battle and many skirmishes in unfamiliar territory we lost in both arms of the service a total of 1killed and wounded and in the entire campaign by land and sea we did not lose a gun or a flag or a transport or a ship and with the exception of the crew of the merrimac not a soldier or sailor was taken prisoner on august 7 fortysix days from the date of the landing of general shafters army in cuba and twentyone days from the surrender of santiago the united states troops commenced embarkation for home and our entire force was returned to the united states as early as august 24 they were absent from the united states only two months it is fitting that i should bear testimony to the patriotism and devotion of that large portion of our army which although eager to be ordered to the post of greatest exposure fortunately was not required outside of the united states they did their whole duty and like their comrades at the front have earned the gratitude of the nation in like manner the officers and men of the army and of the navy who remained in their departments and stations faithfully performing most important duties connected with the war and whose requests for assignment in the field and at sea i was compelled to refuse because their services were indispensable here are entitled to the highest commendation it is my regret that there seems to be no provision for their suitable recognition in this connection it is a pleasure for me to mention in terms of cordial appreciation the timely and useful work of the american national red cross both in relief measures preparatory to the campaigns in sanitary assistance at several of the camps of assemblage and later under the able and experienced leadership of the president of the society miss clara barton on the fields of battle and in the hospitals at the front in cuba working in conjunction with the governmental authorities and under their sanction and approval and with the enthusiastic cooperation of many patriotic women and societies in the various states the red cross has fully maintained its already high reputation for intense earnestness and ability to exercise the noble purposes of its international organization thus justifying the confidence and support which it has received at the hands of the american people to the members and officers of this society and all who aided them in their philanthropic work the sincere and lasting gratitude of the soldiers and the public is due and is freely accorded in tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obligations to the divine master for his watchful care over us and his safe guidance for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgment and offers humble prayer for the continuance of his favor the annihilation of admiral cerveras fleet followed by the capitulation of santiago having brought to the spanish government a realizing sense of the hopelessness of continuing a struggle now become wholly unequal it made overtures of peace through the french ambassador who with the assent of his government had acted as the friendly representative of spanish interests during the war on the 26th of july m cambon presented a communication signed by the duke of almodovar the spanish minister of state inviting the united states to state the terms upon which it would be willing to make peace on the 30th of july by a communication addressed to the duke of almodovar and handed to m cambon the terms of this government were announced substantially as in the protocol afterwards signed on the 10th of august the spanish reply dated august 7 was handed by m cambon to the secretary of state it accepted unconditionally the terms imposed as to cuba puerto rico and an island of the ladrones group but appeared to seek to introduce inadmissible reservations in regard to our demand as to the philippine islands conceiving that discussion on this point could neither be practical nor profitable i directed that in order to avoid misunderstanding the matter should be forthwith closed by proposing the embodiment in a formal protocol of the terms upon which the negotiations for peace were to be undertaken the vague and inexplicit suggestions of the spanish note could not be accepted the only reply being to present as a virtual ultimatum a draft of protocol embodying the precise terms tendered to spain in our note of july 30 with added stipulations of detail as to the appointment of commissioners to arrange for the evacuation of the spanish antilles on august m cambon announced his receipt of full powers to sign the protocol so submitted accordingly on the afternoon of august 12 m cambon as the plenipotentiary of spain and the secretary of state as the plenipotentiary of the united states signed a protocol providing article i spain will relinquish all claim of sovereignty over and title to cuba art ii spain will cede to the united states the island of puerto rico and other islands now under spanish sovereignty in the west indies and also an island in the ladrones to be selected by the united states art iii the united states will occupy and hold the city bay and harbor of manila pending the conclusion of a treaty of peace which shall determine the control disposition and government of the philippines the fourth article provided for the appointment of joint commissions on the part of the united states and spain to meet in havana and san juan respectively for the purpose of arranging and carrying out the details of the stipulated evacuation of cuba puerto rico and other spanish islands in the west indies the fifth article provided for the appointment of not more than five commissioners on each side to meet at paris not later than october and to proceed to the negotiation and conclusion of a treaty of peace subject to ratification according to the respective constitutional forms of the two countries the sixth and last article provided that upon the signature of the protocol hostilities between the two countries should be suspended and that notice to that effect should be given as soon as possible by each government to the commanders of its military and naval forces immediately upon the conclusion of the protocol i issued a proclamation of august 12 suspending hostilities on the part of the united states the necessary orders to that end were at once given by telegraph the blockade of the ports of cuba and san juan de puerto rico was in like manner raised on the 18th of august the muster out of 100volunteers or as near that number as was found to be practicable was ordered on the 1st of december 101officers and men had been mustered out and discharged from the service and 9more will be mustered out by the 10th of this month also a corresponding number of general and general staff officers have been honorably discharged the service the military commissions to superintend the evacuation of cuba puerto rico and the adjacent islands were forthwith appointed for cuba majorgeneral james f wade rearadmiral william t sampson majorgeneral matthew c butler for puerto rico major general john r brooke rearadmiral winfield s schley brigadiergeneral william w gordon who soon afterwards met the spanish commissioners at havana and san juan respectively the puerto rican joint commission speedily accomplished its task and by the 18th of october the evacuation of the island was completed the united states flag was raised over the island at noon on that day the administration of its affairs has been provisionally intrusted to a military governor until the congress shall otherwise provide the cuban joint commission has not yet terminated its labors owing to the difficulties in the way of removing the large numbers of spanish troops still in cuba the evacuation can not be completed before the 1st of january next pursuant to the fifth article of the protocol i appointed william r day lately secretary of state cushman k davis william p frye and george gray senators of the united states and whitelaw reid to be the peace commissioners on the part of the united states proceeding in due season to paris they there met on the 1st of october five commissioners similarly appointed on the part of spain their negotiations have made hopeful progress so that i trust soon to be able to lay a definitive treaty of peace before the senate with a review of the steps leading to its signature i do not discuss at this time the government or the future of the new possessions which will come to us as the result of the war with spain such discussion will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratified in the meantime and until the congress has legislated otherwise it will be my duty to continue the military governments which have existed since our occupation and give to the people security in life and property and encouragement under a just and beneficent rule as soon as we are in possession of cuba and have pacified the island it will be necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form a government for themselves this should be undertaken at the earliest moment consistent with safety and assured success it is important that our relations with this people shall be of the most friendly character and our commercial relations close and reciprocal it should be our duty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the island encourage the industry of the people and assist them to form a government which shall be free and independent thus realizing the best aspirations of the cuban people spanish rule must be replaced by a just benevolent and humane government created by the people of cuba capable of performing all international obligations and which shall encourage thrift industry and prosperity and promote peace and good will among all of the inhabitants whatever may have been their relations in the past neither revenge nor passion should have a place in the new government until there is complete tranquillity in the island and a stable government inaugurated military occupation will be continued with the one exception of the rupture with spain the intercourse of the united states with the great family of nations has been marked with cordiality and the close of the eventful year finds most of the issues that necessarily arise in the complex relations of sovereign states adjusted or presenting no serious obstacle to a just and honorable solution by amicable agreement a long unsettled dispute as to the extended boundary between the argentine republic and chile stretching along the andean crests from the southern border of the atacama desert to magellan straits nearly a third of the length of the south american continent assumed an acute stage in the early part of the year and afforded to this government occasion to express the hope that the resort to arbitration already contemplated by existing conventions between the parties might prevail despite the grave difficulties arising in its application i am happy to say that arrangements to this end have been perfected the questions of fact upon which the respective commissioners were unable to agree being in course of reference to her britannic majesty for determination a residual difference touching the northern boundary line across the atacama desert for which existing treaties provided no adequate adjustment bids fair to be settled in like manner by a joint commission upon which the united states minister at buenos ayres has been invited to serve as umpire in the last resort i have found occasion to approach the argentine government with a view to removing differences of rate charges imposed upon the cables of an american corporation in the transmission between buenos ayres and the cities of uruguay and brazil of through messages passing from and to the united states although the matter is complicated by exclusive concessions by uruguay and brazil to foreign companies there is strong hope that a good understanding will be reached and that the important channels of commercial communication between the united states and the atlantic cities of south america may be freed from an almost prohibitory discrimination in this relation i may be permitted to express my sense of the fitness of an international agreement whereby the interchange of messages over connecting cables may be regulated on a fair basis of uniformity the world has seen the postal system developed from a congeries of independent and exclusive services into a well ordered union of which all countries enjoy the manifold benefits it would be strange were the nations not in time brought to realize that modern civilization which owes so much of its progress to the annihilation of space by the electric force demands that this counterguerrilla means of communication be a heritage of all peoples to be administered and regulated in their common behoof a step in this direction was taken when the international convention of for the protection of submarine cables was signed and the day is i trust not far distant when this medium for the transmission of thought from land to land may be brought within the domain of international concert as completely as is the material carriage of commerce and correspondence upon the face of the waters that divide them the claim of thomas jefferson page against argentina which has been pending many years has been adjusted the sum awarded by the congress of argentina was 424235 the sympathy of the american people has justly been offered to the ruler and the people of austriahungary by reason of the affliction that has lately befallen them in the assassination of the empress queen of that historic realm on the 10th of september 1897 a conflict took place at lattimer pa between a body of striking miners and the sheriff of luzerne county and his deputies in which miners were killed and wounded of whom of the killed and of the wounded were austrian and hungarian subjects this deplorable event naturally aroused the solicitude of the austrohungarian government which on the assumption that the killing and wounding involved the unjustifiable misuse of authority claimed reparation for the sufferers apart from the searching investigation and peremptory action of the authorities of pennsylvania the federal executive took appropriate steps to learn the merits of the case in order to be in a position to meet the urgent complaint of a friendly power the sheriff and his deputies having been indicted for murder were tried and acquitted after protracted proceedings and the hearing of hundreds of witnesses on the ground that the killing was in the line of their official duty to uphold law and preserve public order in the state a representative of the department of justice attended the trial and reported its course fully with all the facts in its possession this government expects to reach a harmonious understanding on the subject with that of austriahungary notwithstanding the renewed claim of the latter after learning the result of the trial for indemnity for its injured subjects despite the brief time allotted for preparation the exhibits of this country at the universal exposition at brussels in enjoyed the singular distinction of a larger proportion of awards having regard to the number and classes of articles entered than those of other countries the worth of such a result in making known our national capacity to supply the worlds markets is obvious exhibitions of this international character are becoming more frequent as the exchanges of commercial countries grow more intimate and varied hardly a year passes that this government is not invited to national participation at some important foreign center but often on too short notice to permit of recourse to congress for the power and means to do so my predecessors have suggested the advisability of providing by a general enactment and a standing appropriation for accepting such invitations and for representation of this country by a commission this plan has my cordial approval i trust that the belgian restrictions on the importation of cattle from the united states originally adopted as a sanitary precaution will at an early day be relaxed as to their present features of hardship and discrimination so as to admit live cattle under due regulation of their slaughter after landing i am hopeful too of favorable change in the belgian treatment of our preserved and salted meats the growth of direct trade between the two countries not alone for belgian consumption and belgian products but by way of transit from and to other continental states has been both encouraging and beneficial no effort will be spared to enlarge its advantages by seeking the removal of needless impediments and by arrangements for increased commercial exchanges the years events in central america deserve more than passing mention a menacing rupture between costa rica and nicaragua was happily composed by the signature of a convention between the parties with the concurrence of the guatemalan representative as a mediator the act being negotiated and signed on board the united states steamer alert then lying in central american waters it is believed that the good offices of our envoy and of the commander of that vessel contributed toward this gratifying outcome in my last annual message the situation was presented with respect to the diplomatic representation of this government in central america created by the association of nicaragua honduras and salvador under the title of the greater republic of central america and the delegation of their international functions to the diet thereof while the representative character of the diet was recognized by my predecessor and has been confirmed during my administration by receiving its accredited envoy and granting exequaturs to consuls commissioned under its authority that recognition was qualified by the distinct understanding that the responsibility of each of the component sovereign republics toward the united states remained wholly unaffected this proviso was needful inasmuch as the compact of the three republics was at the outset an association whereby certain representative functions were delegated to a tripartite commission rather than a federation possessing centralized powers of government and administration in this view of their relation and of the relation of the united states to the several republics a change in the representation of this country in central america was neither recommended by the executive nor initiated by congress thus leaving one of our envoys accredited as heretofore separately to two states of the greater republic nicaragua and salvador and to a third state costa rica which was not a party to the compact while our other envoy was similarly accredited to a union state honduras and a nonunion state guatemala the result has been that the one has presented credentials only to the president of costa rica the other having been received only by the government of guatemala subsequently the three associated republics entered into negotiations for taking the steps forecast in the original compact a convention of their delegates framed for them a federal constitution under the name of the united states of central america and provided for a central federal government and legislature upon ratification by the constituent states the 1st of november last was fixed for the new system to go into operation within a few weeks thereafter the plan was severely tested by revolutionary movements arising with a consequent demand for unity of action on the part of the military power of the federal states to suppress them under this strain the new union seems to have been weakened through the withdrawal of its more important members this government was not officially advised of the installation of the federation and has maintained an attitude of friendly expectancy while in no wise relinquishing the position held from the outset that the responsibilities of the several states toward us remained unaltered by their tentative relations among themselves the nicaragua canal commission under the chairmanship of rearadmiral john g walker appointed july 24 1897 under the authority of a provision in the sundry civil act of june of that year has nearly completed its labors and the results of its exhaustive inquiry into the proper route the feasibility and the cost of construction of an interoceanic canal by a nicaraguan route will be laid before you in the performance of its task the commission received all possible courtesy and assistance from the governments of nicaragua and costa rica which thus testified their appreciation of the importance of giving a speedy and practical outcome to the great project that has for so many years engrossed the attention of the respective countries as the scope of the recent inquiry embraced the whole subject with the aim of making plans and surveys for a canal by the most convenient route it necessarily included a review of the results of previous surveys and plans and in particular those adopted by the maritime canal company under its existing concessions from nicaragua and costa rica so that to this extent those grants necessarily hold as essential a part in the deliberations and conclusions of the canal commission as they have held and must needs hold in the discussion of the matter by the congress under these circumstances and in view of overtures made to the governments of nicaragua and costa rica by other parties for a new canal concession predicated on the assumed approaching lapse of the contracts of the maritime canal company with those states i have not hesitated to express my conviction that considerations of expediency and international policy as between the several governments interested in the construction and control of an interoceanic canal by this route require the maintenance of the status quo until the canal commission shall have reported and the united states congress shall have had the opportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter during the present session without prejudice by reason of any change in the existing conditions nevertheless it appears that the government of nicaragua as one of its last sovereign acts before merging its powers in those of the newly formed united states of central america has granted an optional concession to another association to become effective on the expiration of the present grant it does not appear what surveys have been made or what route is proposed under this contingent grant so that an examination of the feasibility of its plans is necessarily not embraced in the report of the canal commission all these circumstances suggest the urgency of some definite action by the congress at this session if the labors of the past are to be utilized and the linking of the atlantic and pacific oceans by a practical waterway is to be realized that the construction of such a maritime highway is now more than ever indispensable to that intimate and ready intercommunication between our eastern and western seaboards demanded by the annexation of the hawaiian islands and the prospective expansion of our influence and commerce in the pacific and that our national policy now more imperatively than ever calls for its control by this government are propositions which i doubt not the congress will duly appreciate and wisely act upon a convention providing for the revival of the late united states and chilean claims commission and the consideration of claims which were duly presented to the late commission but not considered because of the expiration of the time limited for the duration of the commission was signed may 24 1897 and has remained unacted upon by the senate the term therein fixed for effecting the exchange of ratifications having elapsed the convention falls unless the time be extended by amendment which i am endeavoring to bring about with the friendly concurrence of the chilean government the united states has not been an indifferent spectator of the extraordinary events transpiring in the chinese empire whereby portions of its maritime provinces are passing under the control of various european powers but the prospect that the vast commerce which the energy of our citizens and the necessity of our staple productions for chinese uses has built up in those regions may not be prejudiced through any exclusive treatment by the new occupants has obviated the need of our country becoming an actor in the scene our position among nations having a large pacific coast and a constantly expanding direct trade with the farther orient gives us the equitable claim to consideration and friendly treatment in this regard and it will be my aim to subserve our large interests in that quarter by all means appropriate to the constant policy of our government the territories of kiaochow of weihai wei and of port arthur and talienwan leased to germany great britain and russia respectively for terms of years will it is announced be open to international commerce during such alien occupation and if no discriminating treatment of american citizens and their trade be found to exist or be hereafter developed the desire of this government would appear to be realized in this relation as showing the volume and value of our exchanges with china and the peculiarly favorable conditions which exist for their expansion in the normal course of trade i refer to the communication addressed to the speaker of the house of representatives by the secretary of the treasury on the 14th of last june with its accompanying letter of the secretary of state recommending an appropriation for a commission to study the commercial and industrial conditions in the chinese empire and report as to the opportunities for and obstacles to the enlargement of markets in china for the raw products and manufactures of the united states action was not taken thereon during the late session i cordially urge that the recommendation receive at your hands the consideration which its importance and timeliness merit meanwhile there may be just ground for disquietude in view of the unrest and revival of the old sentiment of opposition and prejudice to alien people which pervades certain of the chinese provinces as in the case of the attacks upon our citizens in szechuen and at kutien in 1895 the united states minister has been instructed to secure the fullest measure of protection both local and imperial for any menaced american interests and to demand in case of lawless injury to person or property instant reparation appropriate to the case war ships have been stationed at tientsin for more ready observation of the disorders which have invaded even the chinese capital so as to be in a position to act should need arise while a guard of marines has been sent to peking to afford the minister the same measure of authoritative protection as the representatives of other nations have been constrained to employ following close upon the rendition of the award of my predecessor as arbitrator of the claim of the italian subject cerruti against the republic of colombia differences arose between the parties to the arbitration in regard to the scope and extension of the award of which certain articles were contested by colombia while italy claimed their literal fulfillment the award having been made by the president of the united states as an act of friendly consideration and with the sole view to an impartial composition of the matter in dispute i could not but feel deep concern at such a miscarriage and while unable to accept the colombian theory that i in my official capacity possessed continuing functions as arbitrator with power to interpret or revise the terms of the award my best efforts were lent to bring the parties to a harmonious agreement as to the execution of its provisions a naval demonstration by italy resulted in an engagement to pay the liabilities claimed upon their ascertainment but this apparent disposition of the controversy was followed by a rupture of diplomatic intercourse between colombia and italy which still continues although fortunately without acute symptoms having supervened notwithstanding this efforts are reported to be continuing for the ascertainment of colombias contingent liability on account of cerrutis debts under the fifth article of the award a claim of an american citizen against the dominican republic for a public bridge over the ozama river which has been in diplomatic controversy for several years has been settled by expert arbitration and an award in favor of the claimant amounting to about 90000 it however remains unpaid despite urgent demands for its settlement according to the terms of the compact there is now every prospect that the participation of the united states in the universal exposition to be held in paris in will be on a scale commensurate with the advanced position held by our products and industries in the worlds chief marts the preliminary report of mr moses p handy who under the act approved july 19 1897 was appointed special commissioner with a view to securing all attainable information necessary to a full and complete understanding by congress in regard to the participation of this government in the paris exposition was laid before you by my message of december 6 1897 and showed the large opportunities opened to make known our national progress in arts science and manufactures as well as the urgent need of immediate and adequate provision to enable due advantage thereof to be taken mr handys death soon afterwards rendered it necessary for another to take up and complete his unfinished work and on january last mr thomas w cridler third assistant secretary of state was designated to fulfill that task his report was laid before you by my message of june 14 1898 with the gratifying result of awakening renewed interest in the projected display by a provision in the sundry civil appropriation act of july 1 1898 a sum not to exceed 650was allotted for the organization of a commission to care for the proper preparation and installation of american exhibits and for the display of suitable exhibits by the several executive departments particularly by the department of agriculture the fish commission and the smithsonian institution in representation of the government of the united states pursuant to that enactment i appointed mr ferdinand w peck of chicago sidetrack with an assistant sidetrack and a secretary mr peck at once proceeded to paris where his success in enlarging the scope and variety of the united states exhibit has been most gratifying notwithstanding the comparatively limited area of the exposition site less than onehalf that of the worlds fair at chicago the space assigned to the united states has been increased from the absolute allotment of 157square feet reported by mr handy to some 202square feet with corresponding augmentation of the field for a truly characteristic representation of the various important branches of our countrys development mr pecks report will be laid before you in my judgment its recommendations will call for your early consideration especially as regards an increase of the appropriation to at least one million dollars in all so that not only may the assigned space be fully taken up by the best possible exhibits in every class but the preparation and installation be on so perfect a scale as to rank among the first in that unparalleled competition of artistic and inventive production and thus counterbalance the disadvantage with which we start as compared with other countries whose appropriations are on a more generous scale and whose preparations are in a state of much greater forwardness than ourwhere our artisans have the admitted capacity to excel where our inventive genius has initiated many of the grandest discoveries of these later days of the century and where the native resources of our land are as limitless as they are valuable to supply the worlds needs it is our province as it should be our earnest care to lead in the march of human progress and not rest content with any secondary place moreover if this be due to ourselves it is no less due to the great french nation whose guests we become and which has in so many ways testified its wish and hope that our participation shall befit the place the two peoples have won in the field of universal development the commercial arrangement made with france on the 28th of may 1898 under the provisions of section of the tariff act of 1897 went into effect on the 1st day of june following it has relieved a portion of our export trade from serious embarrassment further negotiations are now pending under section of the same act with a view to the increase of trade between the two countries to their mutual advantage negotiations with other governments in part interrupted by the war with spain are in progress under both sections of the tariff act i hope to be able to announce some of the results of these negotiations during the present session of congress negotiations to the same end with germany have been set on foot meanwhile no effort has been relaxed to convince the imperial government of the thoroughness of our inspection of pork products for exportation and it is trusted that the efficient administration of this measure by the department of agriculture will be recognized as a guaranty of the healthfulness of the food staples we send abroad to countries where their use is large and necessary i transmitted to the senate on the 10th of february last information touching the prohibition against the importation of fresh fruits from this country which had then recently been decreed by germany on the ground of danger of disseminating the san jose scale insect this precautionary measure was justified by germany on the score of the drastic steps taken in several states of the union against the spread of the pest the elaborate reports of the department of agriculture being put in evidence to show the danger to german fruit growing interests should the scale obtain a lodgment in that country temporary relief was afforded in the case of large consignments of fruit then on the way by inspection and admission when found noninfected later the prohibition was extended to dried fruits of every kind but was relaxed so as to apply only to unpeeled fruit and fruit waste as was to be expected the alarm reached to other countries and switzerland has adopted a similar inhibition efforts are in progress to induce the german and swiss governments to relax the prohibition in favor of dried fruits shown to have been cured under circumstances rendering the existence of animal life impossible our relations with great britain have continued on the most friendly footing assenting to our request the protection of americans and their interests in spanish jurisdiction was assumed by the diplomatic and consular representatives of great britain who fulfilled their delicate and arduous trust with tact and zeal eliciting high commendation i may be allowed to make fitting allusion to the instance of mr ramsden her majestys consul at santiago de cuba whose untimely death after distinguished service and untiring effort during the siege of that city was sincerely lamented in the early part of april last pursuant to a request made at the instance of the secretary of state by the british ambassador at this capital the canadian government granted facilities for the passage of four united states revenue cutters from the great lakes to the atlantic coast by way of the canadian canals and the st lawrence river the vessels had reached lake ontario and were there awaiting the opening of navigation when war was declared between the united states and spain her majestys government thereupon by a communication of the latter part of april stated that the permission granted before the outbreak of hostilities would not be withdrawn provided the united states government gave assurance that the vessels in question would proceed direct to a united states port without engaging in any hostile operation this government promptly agreed to the stipulated condition it being understood that the vessels would not be prohibited from resisting any hostile attack it will give me especial satisfaction if i shall be authorized to communicate to you a favorable conclusion of the pending negotiations with great britain in respect to the dominion of canada it is the earnest wish of this government to remove all sources of discord and irritation in our relations with the neighboring dominion the trade between the two countries is constantly increasing and it is important to both countries that all reasonable facilities should be granted for its development the government of greece strongly urges the onerousness of the duty here imposed upon the currants of that country amounting to per cent or more of their market value this fruit is stated to be exclusively a greek product not coming into competition with any domestic product the question of reciprocal commercial relations with greece including the restoration of currants to the free list is under consideration the long standing claim of bernard campbell for damages for injuries sustained from a violent assault committed against him by military authorities in the island of haiti has been settled by the agreement of that republic to pay him 10in american gold of this sum 5has already been paid it is hoped that other pending claims of american citizens against that republic may be amicably adjusted pending the consideration by the senate of the treaty signed june 1897 by the plenipotentiaries of the united states and of the republic of hawaii providing for the annexation of the islands a joint resolution to accomplish the same purpose by accepting the offered cession and incorporating the ceded territory into the union was adopted by the congress and approved july 7 1898 i thereupon directed the united states steamship philadelphia to convey rearadmiral miller to honolulu and intrusted to his hands this important legislative act to be delivered to the president of the republic of hawaii with whom the admiral and the united states minister were authorized to make appropriate arrangements for transferring the sovereignty of the islands to the united states this was simply but impressively accomplished on the 12th of august last by the delivery of a certified copy of the resolution to president dole who thereupon yielded up to the representative of the government of the united states the sovereignty and public property of the hawaiian islands pursuant to the terms of the joint resolution and in exercise of the authority thereby conferred upon me i directed that the civil judicial and military powers theretofore exercised by the officers of the government of the republic of hawaii should continue to be exercised by those officers until congress shall provide a government for the incorporated territory subject to my power to remove such officers and to fill vacancies the president officers and troops of the republic thereupon took the oath of allegiance to the united states thus providing for the uninterrupted continuance of all the administrative and municipal functions of the annexed territory until congress shall otherwise enact following the further provision of the joint resolution i appointed the hons shelby m cullom of illinois john t morgan of alabama robert r hitt of illinois sanford b dole of hawaii and walter f frear of hawaii as commissioners to confer and recommend to congress such legislation concerning the hawaiian islands as they should deem necessary or proper the commissioners having fulfilled the mission confided to them their report will be laid before you at an early day it is believed that their recommendations will have the earnest consideration due to the magnitude of the responsibility resting upon you to give such shape to the relationship of those mid pacific lands to our home union as will benefit both in the highest degree realizing the aspirations of the community that has cast its lot with us and elected to share our political heritage while at the same time justifying the foresight of those who for three quarters of a century have looked to the assimilation of hawaii as a natural and inevitable consummation in harmony with our needs and in fulfillment of our cherished traditions the questions heretofore pending between hawaii and japan growing out of the alleged mistreatment of japanese treaty immigrants were i am pleased to say adjusted before the act of transfer by the payment of a reasonable indemnity to the government of japan under the provisions of the joint resolution the existing customs relations of the hawaiian islands with the united states and with other countries remain unchanged until legislation shall otherwise provide the consuls of hawaii here and in foreign countries continue to fulfill their commercial agencies while the united states consulate at honolulu is maintained for all appropriate services pertaining to trade and the revenue it would be desirable that all foreign consuls in the hawaiian islands should receive new exequaturs from this government the attention of congress is called to the fact that our consular offices having ceased to exist in hawaii and being about to cease in other countries coming under the sovereignty of the united states the provisions for the relief and transportation of destitute american seamen in these countries under our consular regulations will in consequence terminate it is proper therefore that new legislation should be enacted upon this subject in order to meet the changed conditions the interpretation of certain provisions of the extradition convention of december 11 1861 has been at various times the occasion of controversy with the government of mexico an acute difference arose in the case of the mexican demand for the delivery of jesus guerra who having led a marauding expedition near the border with the proclaimed purpose of initiating an insurrection against president diaz escaped into texas extradition was refused on the ground that the alleged offense was political in its character and therefore came within the treaty proviso of nonsurrender the mexican contention was that the exception only related to purely political offenses and that as guerras acts were admixed with the common crime of murder arson kidnaping and robbery the option of nondelivery became void a position which this government was unable to admit in view of the received international doctrine and practice in the matter the mexican government in view of this gave notice january 24 1898 of the termination of the convention to take effect twelve months from that date at the same time inviting the conclusion of a new convention toward which negotiations are on foot in this relation i may refer to the necessity of some amendment of our existing extradition statute it is a common stipulation of such treaties that neither party shall be bound to give up its own citizens with the added proviso in one of our treaties that with japan that it may surrender if it see fit it is held in this country by an almost uniform course of decisions that where a treaty negatives the obligation to surrender the president is not invested with legal authority to act the conferment of such authority would be in the line of that sound morality which shrinks from affording secure asylum to the author of a heinous crime again statutory provision might well be made for what is styled extradition by way of transit whereby a fugitive surrendered by one foreign government to another may be conveyed across the territory of the united states to the jurisdiction of the demanding state a recommendation in this behalf made in the presidents message of was not acted upon the matter is presented for your consideration the problem of the mexican free zone has been often discussed with regard to its inconvenience as a provocative of smuggling into the united states along an extensive and thinly guarded land border the effort made by the joint resolution of march 1 1895 to remedy the abuse charged by suspending the privilege of free transportation in bond across the territory of the united states to mexico failed of good result as is stated in report no of the house of representatives submitted in the last session march 11 1898 as the question is one to be conveniently met by wise concurrent legislation of the two countries looking to the protection of the revenues by harmonious measures operating equally on either side of the boundary rather than by conventional arrangements i suggest that congress consider the advisability of authorizing and inviting a conference of representatives of the treasury departments of the united states and mexico to consider the subject in all its complex bearings and make report with pertinent recommendations to the respective governments for the information and consideration of their congresses the mexican water boundary commission has adjusted all matters submitted to it to the satisfaction of both governments save in three important cases that of the \\u00e2chamizal\\u00e2 at el paso tex where the two commissioners failed to agree and wherein for this case only this government has proposed to mexico the addition of a third member the proposed elimination of what are known as \\u00e2bancos\\u00e2 small isolated islands formed by the cutting off of bends in the rio grande from the operation of the treaties of and 1889 recommended by the commissioners and approved by this government but still under consideration by mexico and the subject of the \\u00e2equitable distribution of the waters of the rio grande\\u00e2 for which the commissioners recommended an international dam and reservoir approved by mexico but still under consideration by this government pending these questions it is necessary to extend the life of the commission which expires december next the coronation of the young queen of the netherlands was made the occasion of fitting congratulations the claim of victor h mccord against peru which for a number of years has been pressed by this government and has on several occasions attracted the attention of the congress has been satisfactorily adjusted a protocol was signed may 17 1898 whereby the fact of liability being admitted the question of the amount to be awarded was submitted to the chief justice of canada as sole arbitrator his award sets the indemnity due the claimant at 40000 the government of peru has given the prescribed notification of its intention to abrogate the treaty of friendship commerce and navigation concluded with this country august 31 1887 as that treaty contains many important provisions necessary to the maintenance of commerce and good relations which could with difficulty be replaced by the negotiation of renewed provisions within the brief twelve months intervening before the treaty terminates i have invited suggestions by peru as to the particular provisions it is desired to annul in the hope of reaching an arrangement whereby the remaining articles may be provisionally saved his majesty the czar having announced his purpose to raise the imperial russian mission at this capital to the rank of an embassy i responded under the authority conferred by the act of march 3 1893 by commissioning and accrediting the actual representative at st petersburg in the capacity of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary the russian ambassador to this country has since presented his credentials the proposal of the czar for a general reduction of the vast military establishments that weigh so heavily upon many peoples in time of peace was communicated to this government with an earnest invitation to be represented in the conference which it is contemplated to assemble with a view to discussing the means of accomplishing so desirable a result his majesty was at once informed of the cordial sympathy of this government with the principle involved in his exalted proposal and of the readiness of the united states to take part in the conference the active military force of the united states as measured by our population territorial area and taxable wealth is and under any conceivable prospective conditions must continue to be in time of peace so conspicuously less than that of the armed powers to whom the czars appeal is especially addressed that the question can have for us no practical importance save as marking an auspicious step toward the betterment of the condition of the modern peoples and the cultivation of peace and good will among them but in this view it behooves us as a nation to lend countenance and aid to the beneficent project the claims of owners of american sealing vessels for seizure by russian cruisers in bering sea are being pressed to a settlement the equities of the cases justify the expectation that a measure of reparation will eventually be accorded in harmony with precedent and in the light of the proven facts the recommendation made in my special message of april last is renewed that appropriation be made to reimburse the master and owners of the russian bark hans for wrongful arrest of the master and detention of the vessel in february 1896 by officers of the united states district court for the southern district of mississippi the papers accompanying my said message make out a most meritorious claim and justify the urgency with which it has been presented by the government of russia malietoa laupepa king of samoa died on august last according to article i of the general act of berlin \\u00e2his successor shall be duly elected according to the laws and customs of samoa\\u00e2 arrangements having been agreed upon between the signatories of the general act for the return of mataafa and the other exiled samoan chiefs they were brought from jaluit by a german war vessel and landed at apia on september last whether the death of malietoa and the return of his old time rival mataafa will add to the undesirable complications which the execution of the tripartite general act has heretofore developed remains to be seen the efforts of this government will as heretofore be addressed toward a harmonious and exact fulfillment of the terms of the international engagement to which the united states became a party in 1889 the cheek claim against siam after some five years of controversy has been adjusted by arbitration under an agreement signed july 6 1897 an award of 706ticals about 187 with release of the cheek estate from mortgage claims having been rendered march 21 1898 in favor of the claimant by the arbitrator sir nicholas john hannen british chief justice for china and japan an envoy from siam has been accredited to this government and has presented his credentials immediately upon the outbreak of the war with spain the swiss government fulfilling the high mission it has deservedly assumed as the patron of the international red cross proposed to the united states and spain that they should severally recognize and carry into execution as a modus vivendi during the continuance of hostilities the additional articles proposed by the international conference of geneva october 20 1868 extending the effects of the existing red cross convention of to the conduct of naval war following the example set by france and germany in in adopting such a modus vivendi and in view of the accession of the united states to those additional articles in 1882 although the exchange of ratifications thereof still remained uneffected the swiss proposal was promptly and cordially accepted by us and simultaneously by spain this government feels a keen satisfaction in having thus been enabled to testify its adherence to the broadest principles of humanity even amidst the clash of war and it is to be hoped that the extension of the red cross compact to hostilities by sea as well as on land may soon become an accomplished fact through the general promulgation of the additional naval red cross articles by the maritime powers now parties to the convention of 1864 the important question of the claim of switzerland to the perpetual cantonal allegiance of american citizens of swiss origin has not made hopeful progress toward a solution and controversies in this regard still continue the newly accredited envoy of the united states to the ottoman porte carries instructions looking to the disposal of matters in controversy with turkey for a number of years he is especially charged to press for a just settlement of our claims for indemnity by reason of the destruction of the property of american missionaries resident in that country during the armenian troubles of 1895 as well as for the recognition of older claims of equal justness he is also instructed to seek an adjustment of the dispute growing out of the refusal of turkey to recognize the acquired citizenship of ottomanborn persons naturalized in the united states since without prior imperial consent and in the same general relation he is directed to endeavor to bring about a solution of the question which has more or less acutely existed since concerning the jurisdictional rights of the united states in matters of criminal procedure and punishment under article iv of the treaty of 1830 this latter difficulty grows out of a verbal difference claimed by turkey to be essential between the original turkish text and the promulgated translation after more than two years from the appointment of a consul of this country to erzerum he has received his exequatur the arbitral tribunal appointed under the treaty of february 2 1897 between great britain and venezuela to determine the boundary line between the latter and the colony of british guiana is to convene at paris during the present month it is a source of much gratification to this government to see the friendly resort of arbitration applied to the settlement of this controversy not alone because of the earnest part we have had in bringing about the result but also because the two members named on behalf of venezuela mr chief justice fuller and mr justice brewer chosen from our highest court appropriately testify the continuing interest we feel in the definitive adjustment of the question according to the strictest rules of justice the british members lord herschell and sir richard collins are jurists of no less exalted repute while the fifth member and president of the tribunal m f de martens has earned a world wide reputation as an authority upon international law the claim of felipe scandella against venezuela for arbitrary expulsion and injury to his business has been adjusted by the revocation of the order of expulsion and by the payment of the sum of 16000 i have the satisfaction of being able to state that the bureau of the american republics created in as the organ for promoting commercial intercourse and fraternal relations among the countries of the western hemisphere has become a more efficient instrument of the wise purposes of its founders and is receiving the cordial support of the contributing members of the international union which are actually represented in its board of management a commercial directory in two volumes containing a mass of statistical matter descriptive of the industrial and commercial interests of the various countries has been printed in english spanish portuguese and french and a monthly bulletin published in these four languages and distributed in the latinamerican countries as well as in the united states has proved to be a valuable medium for disseminating information and furthering the varied interests of the international union during the past year the important work of collecting information of practical benefit to american industries and trade through the agency of the diplomatic and consular officers has been steadily advanced and in order to lay such data before the public with the least delay the practice was begun in january 1898 of issuing the commercial reports from day to day as they are received by the department of state it is believed that for promptitude as well as fullness of information the service thus supplied to our merchants and manufacturers will be found to show sensible improvement and to merit the liberal support of congress the experiences of the last year bring forcibly home to us a sense of the burdens and the waste of war we desire in common with most civilized nations to reduce to the lowest possible point the damage sustained in time of war by peaceable trade and commerce it is true we may suffer in such cases less than other communities but all nations are damaged more or less by the state of uneasiness and apprehension into which an outbreak of hostilities throws the entire commercial world it should be our object therefore to minimize so far as practicable this inevitable loss and disturbance this purpose can probably best be accomplished by an international agreement to regard all private property at sea as exempt from capture or destruction by the forces of belligerent powers the united states government has for many years advocated this humane and beneficent principle and is now in position to recommend it to other powers without the imputation of selfish motives i therefore suggest for your consideration that the executive be authorized to correspond with the governments of the principal maritime powers with a view of incorporating into the permanent law of civilized nations the principle of the exemption of all private property at sea not contraband of war from capture or destruction by belligerent powers the secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year ended june 30 1898 including 64751received from sale of pacific railroads amounted to 405321335 and its expenditures to 443168582 there was collected from customs 149575and from internal revenue 170900641 our dutiable imports amounted to 324635479 a decrease of 58156over the preceding year and importations free of duty amounted to 291414175 a decrease from the preceding year of 90524068 internalrevenue receipts exceeded those of the preceding year by 24212067 the total tax collected on distilled spirits was 92546999 on manufactured tobacco 36230522 and on fermented liquors 39515421 we exported merchandise during the year amounting to 1231482330 an increase of 180488from the preceding year it is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts of the government for the year ending june 30 1899 will be 577874647 and its expenditures 689874647 resulting in a deficiency of 112000000 on the 1st of december 1898 there was held in the treasury gold coin amounting to 138441547 gold bullion amounting to 138502545 silver bullion amounting to 93359250 and other forms of money amounting to 451963981 on the same date the amount of money of all kinds in circulation or not included in treasury holdings was 1886879504 an increase for the year of 165794966 estimating our population at 75194at the time mentioned the per capita circulation was 2509 on the same date there was in the treasury gold bullion amounting to 138502545 the provisions made for strengthening the resources of the treasury in connection with the war have given increased confidence in the purpose and power of the government to maintain the present standard and have established more firmly than ever the national credit at home and abroad a marked evidence of this is found in the inflow of gold to the treasury its net gold holdings on november 1 1898 were 239885as compared with 153573on november 1 1897 and an increase of net cash of 207756100 november 1 1897 to 300238275 november 1 1898 the present ratio of net treasury gold to outstanding government liabilities including united states notes treasury notes of 1890 silver certificates currency certificates standard silver dollars and fractional silver coin november 1 1898 was per cent as compared with per cent november 1 1897 i renew so much of my recommendation of december 1897 as follows that when any of the united states notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed in gold such notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold this is an obvious duty if the holder of the united states note prefers the gold and gets it from the government he should not receive back from the government a united states note without paying gold in exchange for it the reason for this is made all the more apparent when the government issues an interestbearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of united states notes a non interestbearing debt surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold if they are put out in any other way they may return again to he followed by another bond issue to redeem them another interestbearing debt to redeem a non interestbearing debt this recommendation was made in the belief that such provisions of law would insure to a greater degree the safety of the present standard and better protect our currency from the dangers to which it is subjected from a disturbance in the general business conditions of the country in my judgment the present condition of the treasury amply justifies the immediate enactment of the legislation recommended one year ago under which a portion of the gold holdings should be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks should be redeemed upon presentation but when once redeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold it is not to be inferred that other legislation relating to our currency is not required on the contrary there is an obvious demand for it the importance of adequate provision which will insure to our future a money standard related as our money standard now is to that of our commercial rivals is generally recognized the companion proposition that our domestic paper currency shall be kept safe and yet be so related to the needs of our industries and internal commerce as to be adequate and responsive to such needs is a proposition scarcely less important the subject in all its parts is commended to the wise consideration of the congress the annexation of hawaii and the changed relations of the united states to cuba puerto rico and the philippines resulting from the war compel the prompt adoption of a maritime policy by the united states there should be established regular and frequent steamship communication encouraged by the united states under the american flag with the newly acquired islands spain furnished to its colonies at an annual cost of about 2000000 steamship lines communicating with a portion of the worlds markets as well as with trade centers of the home government the united states will not undertake to do less it is our duty to furnish the people of hawaii with facilities under national control for their export and import trade it will be conceded that the present situation calls for legislation which shall be prompt durable and liberal the part which american merchant vessels and their seamen performed in the war with spain demonstrates that this service furnishing both pickets and the second line of defense is a national necessity and should be encouraged in every constitutional way details and methods for the accomplishment of this purpose are discussed in the report of the secretary of the treasury to which the attention of congress is respectfully invited in my last annual message i recommended that congress authorize the appointment of a commission for the purpose of making systematic investigations with reference to the cause and prevention of yellow fever this matter has acquired an increased importance as a result of the military occupation of the island of cuba and the commercial intercourse between this island and the united states which we have every reason to expect the sanitary problems connected with our new relations with the island of cuba and the acquisition of puerto rico are no less important than those relating to finance commerce and administration it is my earnest desire that these problems may be considered by competent experts and that everything may be done which the most recent advances in sanitary science can offer for the protection of the health of our soldiers in those islands and of our citizens who are exposed to the dangers of infection from the importation of yellow fever i therefore renew my recommendation that the authority of congress may be given and a suitable appropriation made to provide for a commission of experts to be appointed for the purpose indicated under the act of congress approved april 26 1898 authorizing the president in his discretion \\u00e2upon a declaration of war by congress or a declaration by congress that war exists\\u00e2 i directed the increase of the regular army to the maximum of 62000 authorized in said act there are now in the regular army 57officers and men in said act it was provided that at the end of any war in which the united states may become involved the army shall be reduced to a peace basis by the transfer in the same arm of the service or absorption by promotion or honorable discharge under such regulations as the secretary of war may establish of supernumerary commissioned officers and the honorable discharge or transfer of supernumerary enlisted men and nothing contained in this act shall be construed as authorizing the permanent increase of the commissioned or enlisted force of the regular army beyond that now provided by the law in force prior to the passage of this act except as to the increase of twentyfive majors provided for in section hereof the importance of legislation for the permanent increase of the army is therefore manifest and the recommendation of the secretary of war for that purpose has my unqualified approval there can be no question that at this time and probably for some time in the future 100men will be none too many to meet the necessities of the situation at all events whether that number shall be required permanently or not the power should be given to the president to enlist that force if in his discretion it should be necessary and the further discretion should be given him to recruit for the army within the above limit from the inhabitants of the islands with the government of which we are charged it is my purpose to muster out the entire volunteer army as soon as the congress shall provide for the increase of the regular establishment this will be only an act of justice and will be much appreciated by the brave men who left their homes and employments to help the country in its emergency in my last annual message i stated the union pacific railway main line was sold under the decree of the united states court for the district of nebraska on the 1st and 2d of november of this year the amount due the government consisted of the principal of the subsidy bonds 27236512 and the accrued interest thereon 3121171175 making the total indebtedness 5844822375 the bid at the sale covered the first mortgage lien and the entire mortgage claim of the government principal and interest this left the kansas pacific case unconcluded by a decree of the court in that case an upset price for the property was fixed at a sum which would yield to the government only 2500upon its lien the sale at the instance of the government was postponed first to december 15 1897 and later upon the application of the united states was postponed to the 16th day of february 1898 having satisfied myself that the interests of the government required that an effort should be made to obtain a larger sum i directed the secretary of the treasury under the act passed march 3 1887 to pay out of the treasury to the persons entitled to receive the same the amounts due upon all prior mortgages upon the eastern and middle divisions of said railroad out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated whereupon the attorneygeneral prepared a petition to be presented to the court offering to redeem said prior liens in such manner as the court might direct and praying that thereupon the united states might be held to be subrogated to all the rights of said prior lien holders and that a receiver might be appointed to take possession of the mortgaged premises and maintain and operate the same until the court or congress otherwise directed thereupon the reorganization committee agreed that if said petition was withdrawn and the sale allowed to proceed on the 16th of february 1898 they would bid a sum at the sale which would realize to the government the entire principal of its debt 6303000 believing that no better price could be obtained and appreciating the difficulties under which the government would labor if it should become the purchaser of the road at the sale in the absence of any authority by congress to take charge of and operate the road i directed that upon the guaranty of a minimum bid which should give the government the principal of its debt the sale should proceed by this transaction the government secured an advance of 3803over and above the sum which the court had fixed as the upset price and which the reorganization committee had declared was the maximum which they would pay for the property it is a gratifying fact that the result of these proceedings against the union pacific system and the kansas pacific line is that the government has received on account of its subsidy claim the sum of 6475122375 an increase of 18997over the sum which the reorganization committee originally agreed to bid for the joint property the government receiving its whole claim principal and interest on the union pacific and the principal of its debt on the kansas pacific railroad steps had been taken to foreclose the governments lien upon the central pacific railroad company but before action was commenced congress passed an act approved july 7 1898 creating a commission consisting of the secretary of the treasury the attorneygeneral and the secretary of the interior and their successors in office with full power to settle the indebtedness to the government growing out of the issue of bonds in aid of the construction of the central pacific and western pacific bond aided railroads subject to the approval of the president no report has yet been made to me by the commission thus created whatever action is had looking to a settlement of the indebtedness in accordance with the act referred to will be duly submitted to the congress i deem it my duty to call to the attention of congress the condition of the present building occupied by the department of justice the business of that department has increased very greatly since it was established in its present quarters the building now occupied by it is neither large enough nor of suitable arrangement for the proper accommodation of the business of the department the supervising architect has pronounced it unsafe and unsuited for the use to which it is put the attorneygeneral in his report states that the library of the department is upon the fourth floor and that all the space allotted to it is so crowded with books as to dangerously overload the structure the first floor is occupied by the court of claims the building is of an old and dilapidated appearance unsuited to the dignity which should attach to this important department a proper regard for the safety comfort and convenience of the officers and employees would justify the expenditure of a liberal sum of money in the erection of a new building of commodious proportions and handsome appearance upon the very advantageous site already secured for that purpose including the ground occupied by the present structure and adjoining vacant lot comprising in all a frontage of feet on pennsylvania avenue and a depth of feet in this connection i may likewise refer to the inadequate accommodations provided for the supreme court in the capitol and suggest the wisdom of making provision for the erection of a separate building for the court and its officers and library upon available ground near the capitol the postal service of the country advances with extraordinary growth within twenty years both the revenues and the expenditures of the postoffice department have multiplied threefold in the last ten years they have nearly doubled our postal business grows much more rapidly than our population it now involves an expenditure of 100000a year numbers 73postoffices and enrolls 200employees this remarkable extension of a service which is an accurate index of the public conditions presents gratifying evidence of the advancement of education of the increase of communication and business activity and of the improvement of mail facilities leading to their constantly augmenting use the war with spain laid new and exceptional labors on the postoffice department the mustering of the military and naval forces of the united states required special mail arrangements for every camp and every campaign the communication between home and camp was naturally eager and expectant in some of the larger places of rendezvous as many as 50letters a day required handling this necessity was met by the prompt detail and dispatch of experienced men from the established force and by directing all the instrumentalities of the railway mail and postoffice service so far as necessary to this new need congress passed an act empowering the postmastergeneral to establish offices or branches at every military camp or station and under this authority the postal machinery was speedily put into effective operation under the same authority when our forces moved upon cuba puerto rico and the philippines they were attended and followed by the postal service though the act of congress authorized the appointment of postmasters where necessary it was early determined that the public interests would best be subserved not by new designations but by the detail of experienced men familiar with every branch of the service and this policy was steadily followed when the territory which was the theater of conflict came into our possession it became necessary to reestablish mail facilities for the resident population as well as to provide them for our forces of occupation and the former requirement was met through the extension and application of the latter obligation i gave the requisite authority and the same general principle was applied to this as to other branches of civil administration under military occupation the details are more particularly given in the report of the postmastergeneral and while the work is only just begun it is pleasing to be able to say that the service in the territory which has come under our control is already materially improved the following recommendations of the secretary of the navy relative to the increase of the navy have my earnest of _ _ _ _ for three seagoing sheathed and coppered battle ships of about 13tons trial displacement carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful ordnance for vessels of their class and to have the highest practicable speed and great radius of action estimated cost exclusive of armor and armament 3600each 2 three sheathed and coppered armored cruisers of about 12tons trial displacement carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful ordnance for vessels of their class and to have the highest practicable speed and great radius of action estimated cost exclusive of armor and armament 4000each 3 three sheathed and coppered protected cruisers of about 6tons trial displacement to have the highest practicable speed and great radius of action and to carry the most powerful ordnance suitable for vessels of their class estimated cost exclusive of armor and armament 2150each 4 six sheathed and coppered cruisers of about 2tons trial dis placement to have the highest speed compatible with good cruising qualities great radius of action and to carry the most powerful ordnance suited to vessels of their class estimated cost exclusive of armament 1141each i join with the secretary of the navy in recommending that grades of admiral and vice admiral be temporarily revived to be filled by officers who have specially distinguished themselves in the war with spain i earnestly urge upon congress the importance of early legislation providing for the taking of the twelfth census this is necessary in view of the large amount of work which must be performed in the preparation of the schedules preparatory to the enumeration of the population there were on the pension rolls on june 30 1898 993names an increase of nearly 18over the number on the rolls on the same day of the preceding year the amount appropriated by the act of december 22 1896 for the payment of pensions for the fiscal year of was 140000000 eight million seventy thousand eight hundred and seventytwo dollars and fortysix cents was appropriated by the act of march 31 1898 to cover deficiencies in army pensions and repayments in the sum of 1202033 making a total of 148082available for the payment of pensions during the fiscal year 1898 the amount disbursed from that sum was 14465187980 leaving a balance of 3431unexpended on the 30th of june 1898 which was covered into the treasury there were names added to the rolls during the year by special acts passed at the second session of the fiftyfifth congress making a total of 6pensioners by congressional enactments since 1861 the total receipts of the patent office during the past year were 125394844 the expenditures were 108163379 leaving a surplus of 17231465 the public lands disposed of by the government during the year reached 8453acres an increase of 614acres over the previous year the total receipts from public lands during the fiscal year amounted to 227799518 an increase of 190over the preceding year the lands embraced in the eleven forest reservations which were suspended by the act of june 4 1897 again became subject to the operations of the proclamations of february 22 1897 creating them which added an estimated amount of 19951acres to the area embraced in the reserves previously created in addition thereto two new reserves were created during the year the pine mountain and zaca lake reserve in california embracing 1644acres and the prescott reserve in arizona embracing 10acres while the pecos river reserve in new mexico has been changed and enlarged to include 120additional acres at the close of the year thirty forest reservations not including those of the afognak forest and the fishculture reserve in alaska had been created by executive proclamations under section of the act of march 3 1891 embracing an estimated area of 40719acres the department of the interior has inaugurated a forest system made possible by the act of july 1898 for a graded force of officers in control of the reserves this system has only been in full operation since august but good results have already been secured in many sections the reports received indicate that the system of patrol has not only prevented destructive fires from gaining headway but has diminished the number of fires the special attention of the congress is called to that part of the report of the secretary of the interior in relation to the five civilized tribes it is noteworthy that the general condition of the indians shows marked progress but one outbreak of a serious character occurred during the year and that among the chippewa indians of minnesota which happily has been suppressed while it has not yet been practicable to enforce all the provisions of the act of june 28 1898 \\u00e2for the protection of the people of the indian territory and for other purposes\\u00e2 it is having a salutary effect upon the nations composing the five tribes the dawes commission reports that the most gratifying results and greater advance toward the attainment of the objects of the government have been secured in the past year than in any previous year i can not too strongly indorse the recommendation of the commission and of the secretary of the interior for the necessity of providing for the education of the 30white children resident in the indian territory the department of agriculture has been active in the past year explorers have been sent to many of the countries of the eastern and western hemispheres for seeds and plants that may be useful to the united states and with the further view of opening up markets for our surplus products the forestry division of the department is giving special attention to the treeless regions of our country and is introducing species specially adapted to semiarid regions forest fires which seriously interfere with production especially in irrigated regions are being studied that losses from this cause may be avoided the department is inquiring into the use and abuse of water in many states of the west and collating information regarding the laws of the states the decisions of the courts and the customs of the people in this regard so that uniformity may be secured experiment stations are becoming more effective every year the annual appropriation of 720by congress is supplemented by 400from the states nationwide experiments have been conducted to ascertain the suitableness as to soil and climate and states for growing sugar beets the number of sugar factories has been doubled in the past two years and the ability of the united states to produce its own sugar from this source has been clearly demonstrated the weather bureau forecast and observation stations have been extended around the caribbean sea to give early warning of the approach of hurricanes from the south seas to our fleets and merchant marine in the year will occur the centennial anniversary of the founding of the city of washington for the permanent capital of the government of the united states by authority of an act of congress approved july 16 1790 in may 1800 the archives and general offices of the federal government were removed to this place on the 17th of november 1800 the national congress met here for the first time and assumed exclusive control of the federal district and city this interesting event assumes all the more significance when we recall the circumstances attending the choosing of the site the naming of the capital in honor of the father of his country and the interest taken by him in the adoption of plans for its future development on a magnificent scale these original plans have been wrought out with a constant progress and a signal success even beyond anything their framers could have foreseen the people of the country are justly proud of the distinctive beauty and government of the capital and of the rare instruments of science and education which here find their natural home a movement lately inaugurated by the citizens to have the anniversary celebrated with fitting ceremonies including perhaps the establishment of a handsome permanent memorial to mark so historical an occasion and to give it more than local recognition has met with general favor on the part of the public i recommend to the congress the granting of an appropriation for this purpose and the appointment of a committee from its respective bodies it might also be advisable to authorize the president to appoint a committee from the country at large which acting with the congressional and district of columbia committees can complete the plans for an appropriate national celebration the alien contract law is shown by experience to need some amendment a measure providing better protection for seamen is proposed the rightful application of the eighthour law for the benefit of labor and of the principle of arbitration are suggested for consideration and i commend these subjects to the careful attention of the congress the several departmental reports will be laid before you they give in great detail the conduct of the affairs of the government during the past year and discuss many questions upon which the congress may feel called upon to act\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n
